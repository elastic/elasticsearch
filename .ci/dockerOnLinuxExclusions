# This file specifies the Linux OS versions on which we can't build and
# test Docker images for some reason. These values correspond to ID and
# VERSION_ID from /etc/os-release, and a matching value will cause the
# Docker tests to be skipped on that OS. If /etc/os-release doesn't exist
# (as is the case on centos-6, for example) then that OS will again be
# excluded.

# This file is used as part of a matrix build in Jenkins where the
# values below are included as an axis of the matrix.

# java11 should always be included as we only support Oracle Java 11 in
# FIPS 140-2 mode.
# We also want to test with the bundled JDK so that we proactively find
# issues that might later be backported to JDK11. Current bundled JDK is
# openjdk18

ES_RUNTIME_JAVA:
  - java11

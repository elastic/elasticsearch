        Github is reserved for bug reports and feature requests; it is
        not the place for general questions. If you have a question or
        an unconfirmed bug, please visit the [forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch).
        Please also check your OS is [supported](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_os),
        and that the version of Elasticsearch has not passed [end-of-life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).
        If you are using an unsupported OS or an unsupported version then the issue is likely to be closed.


        For security vulnerabilities please only send reports to security@elastic.co.
        See https://www.elastic.co/community/security for more information.

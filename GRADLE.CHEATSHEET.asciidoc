As a quick helper, below are the equivalent commands from maven to gradle. You can also run `gradle tasks` to see all tasks that are available to run.

| Maven                       | Gradle      | Description         |
| ----------------------------| ------------|---------------------|
| `clean`                     | `clean`     |                     |
| `verify`                    | `check`     |                     |
| `verify -Dskip.unit.tests`  | `integTest` |                     |
| `package -DskipTests`       | `assemble`  |                     |
| `install -DskipTests`       | `install`   |                     |

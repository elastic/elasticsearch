== Core Concepts

Alert     ::  a tuple of: *Schedule*, *Condition* and a list of *Action*s, where the schedule defines when the alert is checked 
              (see below), the condition checks whether the alert should be executed and the actions define what happens when the alert 
              is executed.
Schedule  ::  defines when and how often should the alert be checked (e.g. every 5 minutes, every 
			  first wednesday of the month at noon, etc..)
Condition ::  represents a condition based on which a decision is made to execute the alert or not
Action    ::  defines the actions that are taken when the alert executes


== Alert Events

`checked`     ::  the `Scheduler` fired an event that caused the condition of the alert to be evaluated
`throttled`   ::  the alert's condition was checked and met, but a decision was made **not** to **execute* the alert.
				  This can be based on the throttle period that is associated with the alert, or based on the fact that the 
				  alert was `acked`
`executed`    ::  the alert's condition was checked and met and no throttling took place - the actions were executed.
`acked`       ::  the user acked the alert, causing it to stop executing its action until it's condition is not met anymore

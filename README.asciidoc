= Elasticsearch X Plugins

A set of Elastic's commercial plugins:

- License
- Shield
- Watcher
- Marvel

= Testing with Elasticsearch
Sometimes it is useful to use your local elasticsearch checkout with x-plugins. To do this, run the following commands:
cd buildSrc
gradle attach --name elasticsearch --path /path/to/elasticsearch/buildSrc
cd ..
gradle attach --name elasticsearch --path /path/to/elasticsearch

This will cause building x-plugins to reflect any changes in your elasticsearch repo. For example, if you make a change to elasticsearch core, building x-plugins will first re-build elasticsearch core, and use that when building x-plugins.

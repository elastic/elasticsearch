Elasticsearch to store, search, and manage data for:

[[get-started]]
== Get started

If you want to give Elasticsearch a try, check out our
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html[Quick
start guide].

To get started with the Elastic Stack, see the
https://www.elastic.co/start[Elastic Stack start page].

[[use-release]]
=== Use a release

The best way to use Elasticsearch is our hosted
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service[Elasticsearch Service on Elastic
Cloud].

You can also deploy and self-manage Elasticsearch on your own infrastructure. To
download the latest version, use the
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[download page].

For more installation options, see our
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html[Installation
docs].

[[upgrade]]
=== Upgrade

To upgrade from an earlier version of Elasticsearch, see our
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html[upgrade
documentation].

[[build-source]]
=== Build from source

Elasticsearch uses https://gradle.org[Gradle] for its build system.

To build a distribution for your local OS and print its output location upon
completion, run:
----
./gradlew localDistro
----

To build a distribution for another platform, run the related command:
----
./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble
./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble
./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble
----

To build distributions for all supported platforms, run:
----
./gradlew assemble
----

Distributions are output to `distributions/archives`.

To run the test suite, see xref:TESTING.asciidoc[TESTING].

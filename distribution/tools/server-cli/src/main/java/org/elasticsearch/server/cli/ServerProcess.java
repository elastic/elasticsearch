 * A helper to control a {@link Process} running the main Elasticsearch server.

 * The process is controlled by internally sending arguments and control signals on stdin,
 * and receiving control signals on stderr. The start method does not return until the
 * server is ready to process requests and has exited the bootstrap thread.
 *
 * <p> The caller starting a {@link ServerProcess} can then do one of several things:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Block on the server process exiting, by calling {@link #waitFor()}</li>
 *     <li>Detach from the server process by calling {@link #detach()}</li>
 *     <li>Tell the server process to shutdown and wait for it to exit by calling {@link #stop()}</li>

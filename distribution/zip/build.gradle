    /* HUGE HACK: the underlying maven publication library refuses to deploy any attached artifacts
     * when the packaging type is set to 'pom'. But Sonatype's OSS repositories require source files
     * for artifacts that are of type 'zip'. We already publish the source and javadoc for Elasticsearch
     * under the various other subprojects. So here we create another publication using the same
     * name that has the "real" pom, and rely on the fact that gradle will execute the publish tasks
     * in alphabetical order. This lets us publish the zip file and even though the pom says the
     * type is 'pom' instead of 'zip'. We cannot setup a dependency between the tasks because the
     * publishing tasks are created *extremely* late in the configuration phase, so that we cannot get
     * ahold of the actual task. Furthermore, this entire hack only exists so we can make publishing to
     * maven local work, since we publish to maven central externally. */

  title: Disable machine learning on macOS x86_64
  area: Packaging
  details: The machine learning plugin is permanently disabled on macOS x86_64.
    For the last three years Apple has been selling hardware based on the arm64
    architecture, and support will increasingly focus on this architecture in
    the future. Changes to upstream dependencies of Elastic's machine learning
    functionality have made it unviable for Elastic to continue to build machine
    learning on macOS x86_64.
  impact: To continue to use machine learning functionality on macOS please switch to
    an arm64 machine (Apple silicon). Alternatively, it will still be possible to run
    Elasticsearch with machine learning enabled in a Docker container on macOS x86_64.

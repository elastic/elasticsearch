  title: Add global retention in data stream lifecycle
  body: |-
    Data stream lifecycle now supports configuring retention on a cluster level, namely global retention. Global retention 
    allows us to configure two different retentions:
    
    - `default_retention` is applied to all data streams managed by the data stream lifecycle that do not have retention
    defined on the data stream level.
    - `max_retention` is applied to all data streams managed by the data stream lifecycle and it allows any data stream 
    data to be deleted after the `max_retention` has passed.

    Furthermore, we introduce the term `effective_retention` which is the retention applied at a certain moment to a data
    stream considering all the available retention configurations.

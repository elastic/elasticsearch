  title: "Change `skip_unavailable` remote cluster setting default value to true"
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: The default value of the `skip_unavailable` setting is now set to true.
    All existing and future remote clusters that do not define this setting will use the new default.
    This setting only affects cross-cluster searches using the _search or _async_search API.
  impact: Unavailable remote clusters in a cross-cluster search will no longer cause the search to fail unless
    skip_unavailable is configured to be `false` in elasticsearch.yml or via the `_cluster/settings` API. 
    Unavailable clusters with `skip_unavailable`=`true` (either explicitly or by using the new default) are marked 
    as SKIPPED in the search response metadata section and do not fail the entire search. If users want to ensure that a
    search returns a failure when a particular remote cluster is not available, `skip_unavailable` must be now be 
    set explicitly.    
  notable: true

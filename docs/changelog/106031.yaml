  title: Deprecate allowing `fields` in scenarios where it is ignored
  area: Mapping
  details: The following mapped types have always ignored `fields` when using multi-fields.
    This deprecation makes this clearer and we will completely disallow `fields` for
    these mapped types in the future.
  impact: "In the future, `join`, `aggregate_metric_double`, and `constant_keyword`,\
    \ will all disallow supplying `fields` as a parameter in the mapping."

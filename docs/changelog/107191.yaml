  title: Stricter failure handling in multi-repo get-snapshots request handling
  body: |
    If a multi-repo get-snapshots request encounters a failure in one of the
    targeted repositories then earlier versions of Elasticsearch would proceed
    as if the faulty repository did not exist, except for a per-repository
    failure report in a separate section of the response body. This makes it
    impossible to paginate the results properly in the presence of failures. In
    versions 8.15.0 and later this API's failure handling behaviour has been
    made stricter, reporting an overall failure if any targeted repository's
    contents cannot be listed.

  title: Synthetic `_source` improvements
  body: |-
    There are multiple improvements to synthetic `_source` functionality:

    * Synthetic `_source` is now supported for all field types including `nested` and `object`. `object` fields are supported with `enabled` set to `false`.

    * Synthetic `_source` can be enabled together with `ignore_malformed` and `ignore_above` parameters for all field types that support them.

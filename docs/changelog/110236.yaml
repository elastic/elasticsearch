  title: 'Deprecate absolute size values for `indices.breaker.total.limit` setting'
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: Previously, the value of `indices.breaker.total.limit` could be specified as
    an absolute size in bytes. This setting controls the overal amount of
    memory the server is allowed to use before taking remedial actions. Setting
    this to a specific number of bytes led to strange behaviour when the node
    maximum heap size changed because the circut breaker limit would remain
    unchanged. This would either leave the value too low, causing part of the
    heap to remain unused; or it would leave the value too high, causing the
    circuit breaker to be ineffective at preventing OOM errors.  The only
    reasonable behaviour for this setting is that it scales with the size of
    the heap, and so absolute byte limits are now deprecated.
  impact: Users must change their configuration to specify a percentage instead of
    an absolute number of bytes for `indices.breaker.total.limit`, or else
    accept the default, which is already specified as a percentage.

  title: Deprecate using slm privileges to access ilm
  area: REST API
  details: The `read_slm` privilege can get the ILM status, and
    the `manage_slm` privilege can start and stop ILM. Access to these 
    APIs should be granted using the `read_ilm` and `manage_ilm` privileges
    instead. Access to ILM APIs will be removed from SLM privileges in
    a future major release, and is now deprecated.
  impact: Users that need access to the ILM status API should now 
    use the `read_ilm` privilege. Users that need to start and stop ILM, 
    should use the `manage_ilm` privilege.

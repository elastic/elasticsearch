  title: Always allow rebalancing by default
  body: |-
    In earlier versions of {es} the `cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance` setting defaults to
    `indices_all_active` which blocks all rebalancing moves while the cluster is in `yellow` or `red` health. This was
    appropriate for the legacy allocator which might do too many rebalancing moves otherwise. Today's allocator has
    better support for rebalancing a cluster that is not in `green` health, and expects to be able to rebalance some
    shards away from over-full nodes to avoid allocating shards to undesirable locations in the first place. From
    version 8.16 `allow_rebalance` setting defaults to `always` unless the legacy allocator is explicitly enabled.

  title: Add global retention in data stream lifecycle
  body: "Data stream lifecycle now supports configuring retention on a cluster level,\
    \ namely global retention. Global retention \nallows us to configure two different\
    \ retentions:\n\n- `data_streams.lifecycle.retention.default` is applied to all\
    \ data streams managed by the data stream lifecycle that do not have retention\n\
    defined on the data stream level.\n- `data_streams.lifecycle.retention.max` is\
    \ applied to all data streams managed by the data stream lifecycle and it allows\
    \ any data stream \ndata to be deleted after the `max_retention` has passed."

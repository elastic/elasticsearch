  title: "ESQL: Multi-value fields supported in Geospatial predicates"
  body: |-
    Supporting multi-value fields in `WHERE` predicates is a challenge due to not knowing whether `ALL` or `ANY`
    of the values in the field should pass the predicate.
    For example, should the field `age:[10,30]` pass the predicate `WHERE age>20` or not?
    This ambiguity does not exist with the spatial predicates
    `ST_INTERSECTS` and `ST_DISJOINT`, because the choice between `ANY` or `ALL`
    is implied by the predicate itself.
    Consider a predicate checking a field named `location` against a test geometry named `shape`:

    * `ST_INTERSECTS(field, shape)` - true if `ANY` value can intersect the shape
    * `ST_DISJOINT(field, shape)` - true only if `ALL` values are disjoint from the shape

    This works even if the shape argument is itself a complex or compound geometry.

    Similar logic exists for `ST_CONTAINS` and `ST_WITHIN` predicates, but these are not as easily solved
    with `ANY` or `ALL`, because a collection of geometries contains another collection if each of the contained
    geometries is within at least one of the containing geometries. Evaluating this requires that the multi-value
    field is first combined into a single geometry before performing the predicate check.

    * `ST_CONTAINS(field, shape)` - true if the combined geometry contains the shape
    * `ST_WITHIN(field, shape)` - true if the combined geometry is within the shape
  notable: false

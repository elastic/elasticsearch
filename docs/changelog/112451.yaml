  title: Update data stream lifecycle telemetry to track global retention
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    In this release we introduced global retention settings that fulfil the following criteria:

    - a data stream managed by the data stream lifecycle,
    - a data stream that is not an internal data stream.

    As a result, we defined different types of retention:

    - **data retention**: the retention configured on data stream level by the data stream user or owner
    - **default global retention:** the retention configured by an admin on a cluster level and applied to any
    data stream that doesn't have data retention and fulfils the criteria.
    - **max global retention:** the retention configured by an admin to guard against having long retention periods.
    Any data stream that fulfills the criteria will adhere to the data retention unless it exceeds the max retention,
    in which case the max global retention applies.
    - **effective retention:** the retention that applies on the data stream that fulfill the criteria at a given moment
    in time. It takes into consideration all the retention above and resolves it to the retention that will take effect.

    Considering the above changes, having a field named `retention` in the usage API was confusing. For this reason, we
    renamed it to `data_retention` and added telemetry about the other configurations too.
  impact: Users that use the field `data_lifecycle.retention` should use the `data_lifecycle.data_retention`

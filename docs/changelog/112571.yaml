  title: Deprecate dot-prefixed indices and composable template index patterns
  area: CRUD
  details: "Indices beginning with a dot '.' are reserved for system and internal\
    \ indices, and should not be used by and end-user. Additionally, composable index\
    \ templates that contain patterns for dot-prefixed indices should also be avoided,\
    \ as these patterns are meant for internal use only. In a future Elasticsearch\
    \ version, creation of these dot-prefixed indices will no longer be allowed."
  impact: "Requests performing an action that would create an index beginning with\
    \ a dot (indexing a document, manual creation, reindex), or creating an index\
    \ template with index patterns beginning with a dot, will contain a deprecation\
    \ header warning about dot-prefixed indices in the response."

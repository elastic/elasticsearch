  title: Enable ZStandard compression for indices with index.codec set to best_compression
  body: |-
    Before DEFLATE compression was used to compress stored fields in indices with index.codec index setting set to
    best_compression, with this change ZStandard is used as compression algorithm to stored fields for indices with
    index.codec index setting set to best_compression. The usage ZStandard results in less storage usage with a
    similar indexing throughput depending on what options are used. Experiments with indexing logs have shown that
    ZStandard offers ~12% lower storage usage and a ~14% higher indexing throughput compared to DEFLATE.

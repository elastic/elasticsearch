  title: Remove unsupported legacy value for `discovery.type`
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    Earlier versions of {es} had a `discovery.type` setting which permitted
    values that referred to legacy discovery types. From v9.0.0 onwards, the
    only supported values for this setting are `multi-node` (the default) and
    `single-node`.
  impact: >-
    Remove any value for `discovery.type` from your `elasticsearch.yml`
    configuration file.

  title: Enhance SORT push-down to Lucene to cover references to fields and ST_DISTANCE function
  body: |-
    The most used and likely most valuable geospatial search query in Elasticsearch is the sorted proximity search,
    finding items within a certain distance of a point of interest and sorting the results by distance.
    This has been possible in ES|QL since 8.15.0, but the sorting was done in-memory, not pushed down to Lucene.
    Now the sorting is pushed down to Lucene, which results in a significant performance improvement.

    Queries that perform both filtering and sorting on distance are supported. For example:

    [source,esql]
    ----
    FROM test
    | EVAL distance = ST_DISTANCE(location, TO_GEOPOINT("POINT(37.7749, -122.4194)"))
    | WHERE distance < 1000000
    | SORT distance ASC, name DESC
    | LIMIT 10
    ----

    In addition, the support for sorting on EVAL expressions has been extended to cover references to fields:

    [source,esql]
    ----
    FROM test
    | EVAL ref = field
    | SORT ref ASC
    | LIMIT 10
    ----
  notable: false

  title: "[Inference API] Deprecate elser service"
  area: REST API
  details: The `elser` service of the inference API will be removed in an upcoming release. Please use the elasticsearch service instead. 
  impact: In the current version there is no impact. In a future version, users of the `elser` service will no longer be able to use it, and will be required to use the `elasticsearch` service to access elser through the inference API.

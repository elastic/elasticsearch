  title: The "german2" snowball stemmer is now an alias for the "german" stemmer
  area: Analysis
  details: >-
    Lucene 10 has merged the improved "german2" snowball language stemmer with the
    "german" stemmer. For Elasticsearch, "german2" is now a deprecated alias for
    "german". This may results in slightly different tokens being generated for
    terms with umlaut substitution (like "ue" for "Ã¼" etc...)
  impact: >-
    Replace usages of "german2" with "german" in analysis configuration. Old
    indices that use the "german" stemmer should be reindexed if possible.

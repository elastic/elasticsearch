    Add support for aggregation scoped filters that work dynamically on the
    data in each group.

    Implementation wise, the base AggregateFunction has been extended to 
    allow a filter to be passed on. This is required to incorporate the
    filter as part of the aggregate equality/identity which would fail with 
    the filter as an external component.
    As part of the process, the serialization for the existing aggregations
    had to be fixed so AggregateFunction implementations so that it
    delegates to their parent first.

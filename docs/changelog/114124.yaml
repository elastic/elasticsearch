    Lucene 10 ships with an updated Korean dictionary (mecab-ko-dic-2.1.1).

    experiencing changes in search behaviour on existing data are advised to
    reindex.

    The change is small and should generally provide better analysis results.
    Existing indices for full-text use cases should be reindexed though.

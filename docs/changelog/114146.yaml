  title: Snowball stemmers have been upgraded
  area: Analysis
  details: >-
    Lucene 10 ships with an upgrade of its Snowball stemmers. 
    For details see https://github.com/apache/lucene/issues/13209. Users using
    Snowball stemmers that are experiencing changes in search behaviour on 
    existing data are advised to reindex.
  impact: >-
    The upgrade should generally provide improved stemming results. Small changes
    in token analysis can lead to mismatches with previously index data, so
    existing indices using Snowball stemmers as part of their analysis chain
    should be reindexed.

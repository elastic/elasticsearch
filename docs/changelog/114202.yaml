  title: Remove deprecated `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` setting
  area: 'Cluster and node setting'
  details: >-
    The `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` setting was created as an escape-hatch just in case
    relying on the `cluster.routing.allocation.enable=primaries` setting for allocating searchable snapshots during
    rolling restarts had some unintended side-effects. It has been deprecated since 8.2.0.
  impact: Remove `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` from your settings if present.

  title: Remove `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.enable_for_single_data_node` setting
  area: 'Cluster and node setting'
  details: >-
    Prior to 7.8, whenever a cluster had only a single data node, the watermarks would not be respected.
    In order to change this in 7.8+ in a backwards compatible way, we introduced the 
    `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.enable_for_single_data_node`
    node setting. The setting was deprecated in 7.14 and was made to accept only true in 8.0
  impact: No known end user impact

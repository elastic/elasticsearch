  title: The format of non-detailed error responses is changing in v9
  area: Infra/REST API
  details: |-
    When an error occurs when processing a request, Elasticsearch returns information on that error in the REST response.
    If `http:detailed_errors.enabled: false` is specified in node settings for v8 and below, the format of this response
    changes significantly.
    In Elasticsearch v9, the JSON format of responses with errors when the `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` option is set
    will be the same as when detailed errors are enabled (which is the default).
  impact: "If you have set `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` (the default is `true`)\
    \ the structure of JSON when any exceptions occur will change on Elasticsearch 9.0
  notable: false

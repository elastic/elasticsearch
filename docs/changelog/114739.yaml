summary: Add a basic deprecation warning that the JSON format for non-detailed error responses is changing in v9

deprecation:
  title: The format of non-detailed error responses is changing in v9
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    When an error occurs when processing a request, Elasticsearch returns information on that error in the REST response.
    If `http:detailed_errors.enabled: false` is specified in node settings with the v8 REST API and below,
    the format of this response changes significantly.
    Starting with the v9 REST API, the JSON structure of responses with errors when the `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` option is set
    will be the same as when detailed errors are enabled (which is the default).
    To keep using the existing format for non-detailed error responses, use the v8 REST API.
  impact: |-
      If you have set `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` (the default is `true`)
      the structure of JSON when any exceptions occur will change with the v9 REST API.
      To keep using the existing format, use the v8 REST API.
  notable: false

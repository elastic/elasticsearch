  title: Reworking RRF retriever to be evaluated during rewrite phase
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    In this release (8.16), we have introduced major changes to the retrievers framework 
    and how they can be evaluated, focusing mainly on compound retrievers 
    like `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker`, which allowed us to support full 
    composability (i.e. any retriever can be nested under any compound retriever), 
    as well as supporting additional search features like collapsing, explaining, 
    aggregations, and highlighting.
    
    To ensure consistency, and given that this rework is not available until 8.16, 
    `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker`  retriever queries would now  
    throw an exception in a mixed cluster scenario, where there are nodes 
    both in current or later (i.e. >= 8.16) and previous ( <= 8.15) versions.
    
    As part of the rework, we have also removed the `_rank` property from 
    the responses of an `rrf` retriever.
  impact: |-
    - Users will not be able to use the `rrf` and `text_similarity_reranker` retrievers in a mixed cluster scenario
    with previous releases (i.e. prior to 8.16), and the request will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
    - `_rank` has now been removed from the output of the `rrf` retrievers so trying to directly parse the field
    will throw an exception

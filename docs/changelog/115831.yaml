  title: Minimum shard balancer threshold is now 1.0
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    Earlier versions of {es} accepted any non-negative value for `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold`, but values smaller than
    `1.0` do not make sense and have been ignored since version 8.6.1. From 9.0.0 these nonsensical values are now forbidden.
  impact: Do not set `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` to a value less than `1.0`.
  notable: false

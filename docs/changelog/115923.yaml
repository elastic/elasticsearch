  title: Apply more strict parsing of actions in bulk API
  area: REST API
  details: >-
    Previously, the following classes of malformed input were deprecated but not rejected in the action lines of the a
    bulk request: missing closing brace; additional keys after the action (which were ignored); additional data after
    the closing brace (which was ignored). They will now be considered errors and rejected.
  impact: >-
    Users must provide well-formed input when using the bulk API. (They can request REST API compatibility with v8 to
    get the previous behaviour back as an interim measure.)

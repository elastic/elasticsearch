  title: Change most Elasticsearch timeouts to 400 response instead of 5xx
  area: REST API
  details: When a timeout occurs in most REST requests, whether via a per-request timeout, or a system default, the
    request would return a 5xx response code. The response code from those APIs when a timeout occurs is now 400.
  impact: Adjust any code relying on retrying on 5xx responses for timeouts to look for a 400 response code and
    inspect the response to determine whether a timeout occured.
  notable: false

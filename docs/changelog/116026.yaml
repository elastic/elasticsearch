  title: Change Elasticsearch timeouts to 429 response instead of 5xx
  area: REST API
  details: When a REST request times out, whether via a per-request timeout, or a system default, the request now returns a 429 response code.
  impact: Adjust any code relying on retrying on 5xx responses for timeouts to look for 429 response code.
  notable: false

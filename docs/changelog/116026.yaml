  title: Change Elasticsearch timeouts to 429 response instead of 500
  area: REST API
  details: When a user supplied timeout is sent with a REST request, and the request
    times out, it now returns a 429 response code.
  impact: Adjust any code relying on retrying on 500 responses for timeouts to look for 429 response code.
  notable: false

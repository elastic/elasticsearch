  title: Make `remove_binary` required on `attachment` processors
  area: Ingest
  details: >-
    The `remove_binary` option is now required on the `attachment` ingest processor. (Previously, not setting it would
    result in a deprecation warning and a value of false.)
  impact: >-
    Users should specify a value for the `remove_binary` option when creating `attachment` ingest processors. They
    can set it to false to preserve the previous behavior. However, this can consume a lot of resources, so it is
    normally recommended to set to true. The option will be set to false on existing processors stored in the cluster
    state on upgrade, to preserve the previous behavior.

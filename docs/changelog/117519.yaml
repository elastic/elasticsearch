  title: Remove `data_frame_transforms` roles
  area: Transform
  details: >-
    `data_frame_transforms_admin` and `data_frame_transforms_user` were deprecated in
    Elasticsearch 7 and are being removed in Elasticsearch 9.
    `data_frame_transforms_admin` is now `transform_admin`.
    `data_frame_transforms_user` is now `transform_user`.
    Users must call the `_update` API to replace the permissions on the Transform before the
    Transform can be started.
  impact: >-
    Transforms created with either the `data_frame_transforms_admin` or the
    `data_frame_transforms_user` role will fail to start. The Transform will remain
    in a `stopped` state, and its health will be red while displaying permission failures.

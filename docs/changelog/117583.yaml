  title: Removing index alias creation for deprecated transforms notification index
  area: Transform
  details: >-
    As part of the migration from 7.x to 8.x, the `.data-frame-notifications-1` index
    was deprecated and replaced with the `.transform-notifications-000002` index.
    The index is no longer created by default, all writes are directed to the new index,
    and any clusters with the deprecated index will have an alias created to ensure that
    reads are still retrieving data that was written to the index before the migration to 8.x.
    This change removes the alias from the deprecated index in 9.x. Any clusters with the alias present
    will retain it, but it will not be created on new clusters.
  impact: No known end user impact.

    Configuring a bind DN in an LDAP or Active Directory (AD) realm without
    a corresponding bind password will prevent node from starting
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: -|
    For LDAP or AD authentication realms, setting a bind DN (via the
    `xpack.security.authc.realms.ldap.*.bind_dn` realm setting) without a
    bind password is a misconfiguration that may prevent successful
    authentication to the node. Nodes will fail to start if a bind DN is specified without a password.
  impact: -|
    If you have a bind DN configured for an LDAP or AD authentication
    realm, set a bind password for
    [LDAP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ldap-realm.html#ldap-realm-configuration)
    or [Active
    Directory](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/active-directory-realm.html#ad-realm-configuration).
    Configuring a bind DN without a password prevents the misconfigured node from starting.

  title: Remove date histogram boolean support
  area: Aggregations
  details: Elasticsearch no longer allows running Date Histogram aggregations
           over boolean fields. Instead, use Terms aggregation for boolean
           fields.
  impact: We expect the impact to be minimal, as this never produced good
          results, and has been deprecated for years.
  notable: false

  title: Add new experimental `rank_vectors` mapping for late-interaction second order
    ranking
  body:
      Late-interaction models are powerful rerankers. While their size and overall
      cost doesn't lend itself for HNSW indexing, utilizing them as second order reranking
      can provide excellent boosts in relevance. The new `rank_vectors` mapping allows for rescoring
      over new and novel multi-vector late-interaction models like ColBERT or ColPali.

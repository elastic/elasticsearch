  title: Turn `_source` meta fieldmapper's mode attribute into a no-op
  area: Mapping
  details: The `mode` mapping attribute of `_source` metadata field mapper has been turned into a no-op. Instead the `index.mapping.source.mode` index setting should be used to configure source mode.
  impact: Configuring the `mode` attribute for the `_source` meta field mapper will have no effect on indices created with Elasticsearch 9.0.0 or later. Note that `_source.mode` configured on indices before upgrading to 9.0.0 or later will remain efficive after upgrading.

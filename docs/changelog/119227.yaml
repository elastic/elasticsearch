  title: Remove unfreeze REST endpoint
  area: REST API
  details: >-
    The `/{index}/_unfreeze` REST endpoint is no longer supported. This API was deprecated, and the corresponding
    `/{index}/_freeze` endpoint was removed in 8.0.
  impact: None, since it is not possible to have a frozen index in a version which is readable by Elasticsearch 9.0
  notable: false

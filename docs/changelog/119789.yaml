  title: Remove deprecated `sort_mode` from sort by `_geo_distance`
  area: Search
  details: >-
    The `sort_mode` parameter was replaced by `mode` in 5.0,
    but for backwards compatibility the older syntax has been supported since then.
    Now it is time to remove the deprecated parameter.
  impact: >-
    Users should have been using the newer `mode` parameter for years, so the impact should be minimal.
    Any users still using the old parameter can easily switch to the new one with no change in behavior.

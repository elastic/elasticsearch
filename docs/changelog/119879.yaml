  title: Increase the frozen indices deprecation level to `CRITICAL`
  area: Index setting
  details: >-
    The migration deprecations API previously returned a warning on frozen indices. Support for reading frozen indices
    will be removed in 9.0, so in 8.18 this has been made a critical issue.
  impact: >-
    Users are required to unfreeze any frozen indices before upgrading to 9.x. (N.B. It was impossible to freeze indices
    in 8.x, so this only applies to 7.x indices which have not been reindexed.)

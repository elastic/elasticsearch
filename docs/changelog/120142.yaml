  title: Limit `ByteSizeUnit` to 2 decimals
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: In the past, byte values like `1.25 mb` were allowed but deprecated. Now, values with up to two decimal places are allowed,
    unless the unit is bytes, in which case no decimals are allowed. Values with too many decimal places result in an error.
  impact: Values with more than two decimal places, like `0.123 mb` will be rejected as an error,
    where in the past, they'd be accepted with a deprecation warning.
  notable: false

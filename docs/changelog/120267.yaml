  title: Set allow_partial_search_results=true by default
  area: REST API
  details:
    Before this change, in case of shard failures, EQL queries always returned an error.
    With this change, they will keep running and will return partial results.
  impact:
    EQL queries that would previously fail due to shard failures, will now succeed and return partial results.
    The previous defaults can be restored by setting `xpack.eql.default_allow_partial_results` cluster setting to `false`
    or setting with `allow_partial_search_results` to `false` in the query request.
  notable: false

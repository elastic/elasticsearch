  title: Removing support for types field in watcher search
  area: REST API
  details: >-
    Previously, setting the `input.search.request.types` field in the payload when creating a watcher to an empty array
    was  allowed, although it resulted in a deprecation warning and had no effect (and any value other than an empty
    array would result in an error). Now, support for this field is entirely removed, and the empty array will also
    result in an error.
  impact: Users should stop setting this field (which did not have any effect anyway).
  notable: false

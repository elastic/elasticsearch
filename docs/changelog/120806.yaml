deprecation:
  title: Deprecate certificate based remote cluster security model
  area: Authorization
  details: -|
    <<remote-clusters-cert,_Certificate-based remote cluster security model_>> is deprecated and will be removed
    in a future major version.
    Users are encouraged to <<remote-clusters-migrate, migrate remote clusters from certificate to API key authentication>>.
    The <<remote-clusters-api-key,*API key-based security model*>> is preferred way to configure remote clusters,
    as it allows to follow security best practices when setting up remote cluster connections
    and defining fine-grained access control.
  impact: -|
    If you have configured remote clusters with certificate-based security model, you should
    <<remote-clusters-migrate, migrate remote clusters from certificate to API key authentication>>.
    Configuring a remote cluster using <<remote-clusters-cert,certificate authentication>>,
    generates a warning in the deprecation logs.

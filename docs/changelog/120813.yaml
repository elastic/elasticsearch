  title: Change Semantic Text To Act Like A Normal Text Field
  area: Analysis
  details:
    The previous semantic_text format used a complex subfield structure in _source to store the embeddings.
    This complicated interactions/integrations with semantic_text fields and _source in general.
    This new semantic_text format treats it as a normal text field, where the field's value in _source is the value assigned by the user.
  impact:
    Users who parsed the subfield structure of the previous semantic_text format in _source will need to update their parsing logic.
    The new format does not directly expose the chunks and embeddings generated from the input text.
    The new format will be applied to all new indices, any existing indices will continue to use the previous format.

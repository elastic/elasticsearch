  title: Enable LOOKUP JOIN in non-snapshot builds
  body: |-
    This effectively releases LOOKUP JOIN into tech preview. Docs will
    follow in a separate PR.

    - Enable the lexing/grammar for LOOKUP JOIN in non-snapshot builds.
    - Remove the grammar for the unsupported `| JOIN ...` command (without `LOOKUP` as first keyword). The way the lexer modes work, otherwise we'd also have to enable `| JOIN ...` syntax on non-snapshot builds and would have to add additional validation to provide appropriate error messages.
    - Remove grammar for `LOOKUP JOIN index AS ...` because qualifiers are not yet supported. Otherwise we'd have to put in additional validation as well to prevent such queries.

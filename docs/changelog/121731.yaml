  title: Remove TLSv1.1 from default protocols
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: "TLSv1.1 is no longer enabled by default. Prior to version 9.0, Elasticsearch\
    \ would attempt to enable TLSv1.1 if the JDK supported it. In most cases, including\
    \ all cases where Elasticsearch 8 was running with the bundled JDK, the JDK would\
    \ not support TLSv1.1, so that protocol would not be available in Elasticsearch.\
    \ However, if Elasticsearch was running on an old JDK or a JDK that have been\
    \ reconfigured to support TLSv1.1, then the protocol would automatically be available\
    \ within Elasticsearch. As of Elasticsearch 9.0, this is no longer true. If you\
    \ wish to enable TLSv1.1 then you must enable it within the JDK and also enable\
    \ it within Elasticsearch by using the `ssl.supported_protocols` setting."
  impact: "Most users will not be impacted. If your Elastisearch 8 cluster was using\
    \ a custom JDK and you relied on TLSv1.1, then you will need to explicitly enable\
    \ TLSv1.1 within Elasticsearch (as well as enabling it within your JDK)"

  title: Drop `TLS_RSA` cipher support for JDK 24
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    This change removes `TLS_RSA` ciphers from the list of default supported ciphers,
    for Elasticsearch deployments running on JDK 24.
  impact: >-
    The dropped ciphers are `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
    `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`,
    and `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`. TLS connections to Elasticsearch using these ciphers will no longer work.
    Please configure your clients to use one of supported cipher suites.

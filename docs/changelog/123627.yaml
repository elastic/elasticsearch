deprecation:
  title: Deprecate ability to connect to nodes of versions 8.18 and earlier
  area: REST API
  details: >
    Versions 9.1.0 and later of {es} will not support communication with nodes of versions earlier than 8.19.0,
    so the ability to connect to nodes of earlier versions is deprecated in this version. This applies both to
    communication within a cluster and communication across clusters (e.g. for <<modules-cross-cluster-search,{ccs}>> or
    <<xpack-ccr,{ccr}>>).

    {es} will report in its <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>> each time it opens a connection to a node that
    will not be supported from version 9.1.0 onwards. You must upgrade all your clusters to version 8.19.0 or later
    before upgrading any of your clusters to 9.1.0 or later.
  impact: >
   Upgrade all of your clusters to at least 8.19.0 before upgrading any of them to 9.1.0 or later.

  title: Rename deprecation index template
  area: Logging
  details: The deprecation datastream contains log entries for deprecations that
    occured while Elasticsearch is running. The deprecation log entries had a
    mismatch in their dataset name. In order to avoid changing the dataset
    name in the existing datastream, a new datastream now exists.
  impact: If querying for deprecations previously using the
    `.logs-deprecation.elasticsearch-default` datastream, you should now use the
    `.logs-elasticsearch.deprecation-default` datastream.
  notable: false

  title: Allow direct IO for BBQ rescoring
  body: |-
    BBQ rescoring performance can be drastically affected by the amount of available RAM
    for use for the system page cache. When there is not enough RAM to fit all the
    vector data in memory, BBQ search latencies can be affected by as much as 5000x.
    Specifying the `vector.rescoring.directio=true` Java option on all vector search
    nodes modifies rescoring to use direct IO, which eliminates these very high latencies
    from searches in low-memory scenarios, at a cost of a general reduction
    in vector search performance for BBQ indices.

    This option is released in 9.1 as a tech preview whilst we analyse its effect
    for a variety of use cases.

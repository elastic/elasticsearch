  title: Allow direct IO for BBQ rescoring
  body: |-
    BBQ rescoring performance can be drastically affected by the amount of available
    off-heap RAM for use by the system page cache. When there is not enough off-heap RAM
    to fit all the vector data in memory, BBQ search latencies can be affected by as much as 5000x.
    Specifying the `vector.rescoring.directio=true` Java option on all vector search
    nodes modifies rescoring to use direct IO, which eliminates these very high latencies
    from searches in low-memory scenarios, at a cost of a reduction
    in vector search performance for BBQ indices when the vectors do all fit in memory.

    This option is released in 9.1 as a tech preview whilst we analyse its effect
    for a variety of use cases.

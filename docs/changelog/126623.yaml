  title: Enable synthetic source on normalized keyword mappings
  area: Mapping
  details: |-
    This changes the default behavior for Synthetic Source on keyword fields using normalizers. Prior to this change, normalized keywords were always stored to allow returning the non-normalized values. Under this change, such field will NOT be stored (i.e they will be synthesized from the index when returning source, like all other synthetic source fields).  This should result in considerable space improvement for this use case.
    Users can opt out of this behavior on a per-field basis by setting `synthetic_source_keep` to `all` on the field.
  impact: "By default, normalized keyword fields in synthetic source indices will\
    \ no longer return the non-normalized value in the source."
  notable: false

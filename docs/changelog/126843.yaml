  title: Upgrade `repository-s3` to AWS SDK v2
  body: >-
    In earlier versions of {es} the `repository-s3` plugin was based on the AWS
    SDK v1. AWS will withdraw support for this SDK before the end of the life
    of {es} {minor-version} so we have migrated this plugin to the newer AWS SDK v2.

    The two SDKs are not quite compatible, so please check the breaking changes
    documentation and test the new version thoroughly before upgrading any
    production workloads.

  title: Upgrade `repository-s3` to AWS SDK v2
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    In earlier versions of {es} the `repository-s3` plugin was based on the AWS
    SDK v1. AWS will withdraw support for this SDK before the end of the life
    of {es} {minor-version} so we must migrate to the newer AWS SDK v2.

    Unfortunately there are several differences between the two AWS SDK
    versions which may require you to adjust your system configuration when
    upgrading to {es} {minor-version} or later. These differences include, but
    may not be limited to, the following items.

    * AWS SDK v2 requires users to specify the region to use for signing
      requests, or else to run in an environment in which it can determine the
      correct region automatically. The older SDK would try to determine the
      region based on the endpoint URL as specified with the
      `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.endpoint` setting, together with other data
      drawn from the operating environment, and would ultimately fall back to
      `us-east-1` if no better value could be found.

    * AWS SDK v2 does not support the EC2 IMDSv1 protocol.

    * AWS SDK v2 does not support the
      `com.amazonaws.sdk.ec2MetadataServiceEndpointOverride` system property.

    * AWS SDK v2 does not permit specifying a choice between HTTP and HTTPS so
      the `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.protocol` setting is deprecated and no longer
      has any effect.

    * AWS SDK v2 does not permit control over throttling for retries, so the
      the `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.use_throttle_retries` setting is deprecated
      and no longer has any effect.

    * AWS SDK v2 requires the use of the V4 signature algorithm, so the
      `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.signer_override` setting is deprecated and no
      longer has any effect.

    * AWS SDK v2 does not support the `log-delivery-write` canned ACL.

    * AWS SDK v2 counts 4xx responses differently in its metrics reporting.

    * AWS SDK v2 always uses the regional STS endpoint, whereas AWS SDK v2
      could use either a regional endpoint or the global
      `https://sts.amazonaws.com` one.

  impact: >-
    If you use the `repository-s3` module, test your upgrade thoroughly before
    upgrading any production workloads.

    Adapt your configuration to the new SDK functionality. This includes, but
    may not be limited to, the following items.

    * Specify the correct signing region using the
      `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.region` setting on each node. {es} will try and
      determine the correct region based on the endpoint URL and other data
      drawn from the operating environment but cannot guarantee to do so
      correctly in all cases.

    * If you use IMDS to determine the availability zone of a node or to obtain
      credentials for accessing the EC2 API, ensure that it supports the IMDSv2
      protocol.

    * If applicable, discontinue use of the
      `com.amazonaws.sdk.ec2MetadataServiceEndpointOverride` system property.

    * If applicable, specify that you wish to use the insecure HTTP protocol to
      access the S3 API by setting `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.endpoint` to a URL
      which starts with `http://`.

    * If applicable, discontinue use of the `log-delivery-write` canned ACL.

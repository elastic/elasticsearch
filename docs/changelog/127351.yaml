  title: Allow partial results by default in ES|QL
  area: ES|QL
  details: >-
    In earlier versions of {es}, ES|QL would fail the entire query if it encountered any error. ES|QL now returns partial results instead of failing when encountering errors.

  impact: >-
    Callers should check the `is_partial` flag returned in the response to determine if the result is partial or complete. If returning partial results is not desired, this option can be overridden per request via an `allow_partial_results` parameter in the query URL or globally via the cluster setting `esql.query.allow_partial_results`.

  notable: true

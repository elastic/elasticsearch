  title: Disallow mixed quoted/unquoted patterns in FROM
  area: ES|QL
  details: "Previously, the ES|QL grammar allowed users to individually quote constituent strings in index patterns\
    \ such as \"remote_cluster\":\"index_name\". This would allow users to write complex malformed index patterns\
    \ that often slip through grammar and the subsequent validation. This could result in runtime errors\
    \ that can be misleading. This change simplifies the grammar to early reject such malformed index patterns\
    \ at the parsing stage, allowing users to write simpler queries and see more relevant and meaningful\
    \ errors."
  impact: "Users can write queries with simpler index patterns and see more meaningful and relevant errors."
  notable: false

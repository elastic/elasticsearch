  title: Make S3 custom query parameter optional
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    Earlier versions of Elasticsearch would record the purpose of each S3 API
    call using the `?x-purpose=` custom query parameter. This isn't believed to
    be necessary outside of the ECH/ECE/ECK/... managed services, and it adds
    rather a lot to the request logs, so with this change we make the feature
    optional and disabled by default.
  impact: >-
    If you wish to reinstate the old behaviour on a S3 repository, set
    `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.add_purpose_custom_query_parameter` to `true`
    for the relevant client.

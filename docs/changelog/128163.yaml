  title: Cluster setting "skip_unavailable" catches all runtime errors
  area: ES|QL
  details: "If `skip_unavailable` is set to `true`, the runtime errors from this cluster\
    \ do not lead to a failure of the query. Instead, the cluster is set to `skipped`\
    \ or `partial status, and the query execution continues. This is a breaking change\
    \ from previous versions, where `skip_unavailable` only applied to errors related\
    \ to cluster being unavailable."
  impact: "The errors on remote clusters, e.g. missing indices, will not lead to a\
    \ failure of the query. Instead, the cluster is set to `skipped` or `partial status\
    \ in the response metadata."
  notable: false

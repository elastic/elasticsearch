summary: "Optimize shared blob cache evictions on shard removal
  Shared blob cache evictions occur on the cluster applier thread when shards are
  removed from a node. These can be expensive if a large number of shards are
  being removed. This change uses the context of the removal to avoid unnecessary
  evictions that might hold up the applier thread.

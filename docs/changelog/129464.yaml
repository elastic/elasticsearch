  title: Deprecate `indices.merge.scheduler.use_thread_pool` setting
  area: Ingest
  details: This deprecates the `indices.merge.scheduler.use_thread_pool` node setting that was introduced in #120869. This setting should not normally be used, unless instructed so by engineering to get around temporary issues with the new threadpool-based merge scheduler.
  impact: There should be no impact to users since the setting was not released before its deprecation here (and is not documented).

  title: Unquoted index patterns do not allow `(` and `)` characters
  area: ES|QL
  details: >-
    So far, ES|QL accepted unquoted index patterns containing brackets, eg.

    ```
    FROM index(1) | ENRICH policy(2)
    ```

    This can potentially conflict with subquery syntax, that uses brackets as a delimiter.
    From now on, using brackets is only allowed in quoted index patterns, ie. the query above is no longer valid,
    while the following is valid

    ```
    FROM "index(1)" | ENRICH "policy(2)"
    ```
  impact: "It impacts all the queries that contain brackets in index names or policy names, ie. in FROM, ENRICH and LOOKUP JOIN commands"
  notable: false

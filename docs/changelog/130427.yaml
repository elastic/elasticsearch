  title: Unquoted index patterns do not allow `(` and `)` characters
  area: ES|QL
  details: >-
    Previously, ES|QL accepted unquoted index patterns containing brackets, such as `FROM index(1) | ENRICH policy(2)`.

    This query syntax is no longer valid because it could conflict with subquery syntax, where brackets are used as delimiters.

    Brackets are now only allowed in quoted index patterns. For example: `FROM "index(1)" | ENRICH "policy(2)"`.
  impact: "This affects existing queries containing brackets in index or policy names, i.e. in FROM, ENRICH, and LOOKUP JOIN commands."

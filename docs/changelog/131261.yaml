  title: Enable Failure Store for new logs data streams
  body: |-
    The [Failure Store](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/data-streams/failure-store.md) is now enabled by default for new logs data streams matching the pattern `logs-*-*`. This means that such data streams will now store invalid documents in a
    dedicated failure index instead of rejecting them, allowing better visibility and control over data quality issues without loosing data. This can be [enabled manually](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/data-streams/failure-store.md#set-up-failure-store-existing) for existing data streams. 
    Note: With the failure store enabled, the http response code clients receive when indexing invalid documents will change from `400 Bad Request` to `201 Created`, with an additional response attribute `"failure_store" : "used"`.

  title: Enable failure store for log data streams
  body: |-
    The failure store is now enabled for `log-*-*` data streams. This means that such data streams will now store invalid documents in a
    dedicated failure index instead of rejecting them. Clients that previously received a `400 Bad Request` response when indexing invalid
    documents will now receive a `201 Created` response, that would also contain the marker: `failure_store: used`.

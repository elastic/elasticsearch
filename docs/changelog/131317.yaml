  title: Don't enable norms for fields of type text when the index mode is LogsDB or TSDB
  area: Mapping
  details: "This changes the default behavior for norms on `text` fields in logsdb\
    \ and tsdb indices. Prior to this change, norms were enabled by default, with\
    \ the option to disable them via manual configurations. After this change, norms\
    \ will be disabled by default. Note, because we dont support enabling norms from\
    \ a disabled state, users will not be able to enable norms on `text` fields in\
    \ logsdb and tsdb indices."
  impact: Text fields will no longer be normalized by default in LogsDB and TSDB indicies.
  notable: false

  title: Enable `exclude_source_vectors` by default for new indices
  area: Search
  details: |-
    The `exclude_source_vectors` setting is now enabled by default for newly created indices.
    This means that vector fields (e.g., `dense_vector`) are no longer stored in the `_source` field
    by default, although they remain fully accessible through search and retrieval operations.

    Instead of being persisted in `_source`, vectors are now rehydrated on demand from the underlying
    index structures when needed. This reduces index size and improves performance for typical vector
    search workloads where the original vector values do not need to be part of the `_source`.

    If your use case requires vector fields to be stored in `_source`, you can disable this behavior by
    setting `exclude_source_vectors: false` at index creation time.
  impact: |-
    Vector fields will no longer be stored in `_source` by default for new indices. Applications or tools
    that expect to see vector fields in `_source` (for raw document inspection)
    may need to be updated or configured to explicitly retain vectors using `exclude_source_vectors: false`.

    Retrieval of vector fields via search or the `_source` API remains fully supported.

  title: Remove `PeerFinder` request timeout
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: >-
    There is no need to time out requests sent by the `PeerFinder` during discovery and cluster formation, and this
    timeout may sometimes cause spurious failures. With this change the `PeerFinder` requests will wait indefinitely for
    responses. The `discovery.request_peers_timeout` setting no longer has any effect.
  impact: Discontinue use of the `discovery.request_peers_timeout` setting.

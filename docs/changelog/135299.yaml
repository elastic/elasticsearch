  title: Release DiskBBQ(`bbq_disk`) index type for `dense_vector` fields
  body: |-
     This provides a new index type called DiskBBQ (`bbq_disk`).
     DiskBBQ is a cluster based format that provides:
       - faster and cheaper indexing than HNSW
       - Better behavior in lower memory environments (degrades linearly, not exponentially)
       - Is near HNSW for QPS when the index is in memory

     Current restrictions:
       - only floating point values are allowed currently
       - quantization is only to a single bit, so not recommended for low dimensionality vectors
       - all other restrictions that exist for `dense_vector` fields still apply

     To utilize the format, its just like any other:
     [source,yaml]
     ----------------------------
     PUT vectors
      {
        "mappings": {
          "properties": {
            "vector": {"type": "dense_vector", "index_options": {"type": "disk_bbq"}
          }
        }
      }
     ----------------------------
      Querying is just like any other field.
     [source,yaml]
     ----------------------------
     POST vectors/_search{
       "query": {
         "knn": {
           "field": "vector",
           "query_vector": <vector>,
           "k": 3
         }
       }
     }
     ----------------------------
     `num_candidates` can be used for tuning approximate nature of the search.
     Or, more granular control can be provided by setting `visit_percentage` directly.

  title: ES|QL Empty index resolution
  area: ES|QL
  details: Changes index resolution so that `FROM empty*` resolves to empty set of indices (opposed to error today)
    and becomes consistent with `GET /empty*/_search`.
  impact: Makes a valid query check a bit more permissive in case when pattern is resolved to empty set of indices.
  notable: false

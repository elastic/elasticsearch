  title: Add deprecation notice for `max_size` rollover condition
  area: "REST API"
  details: We have deprecated the `max_size` rollover condition when used in the Put ILM Lifecycle endpoints and the index rollover endpoints
  impact: Users can continue to use this condition however a warning will be issued via the response headers and in the server logs. The condition may be removed fully in a later version of Elasticsearch.

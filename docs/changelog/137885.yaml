  title: Add deprecation lenient booleans usage for analysis boolean setting (3rd party plugins) and boolean system properties.
  area: Logging
  details: Usage of lenient booleans was deprecated for analysis boolean setting in external plugins using the stable plugin API and various boolean system properties.
  impact: Usage of lenient booleans other than `true` or `false` will result in deprecations logs. Future releases of ES may only accept strict boolean values `true` or `false.

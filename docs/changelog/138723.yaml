  title: Enable doc_values skippers
  body: |-
    Doc_values skippers add a sparse index to doc_values fields, allowing efficient
    querying and filtering on a field without having to build a separate BKD or terms 
    index.  These are now enabled automatically on any field configured with
    index=false and doc_values=true.

    TSDB indexes now default to using skippers in place of indexes for their 
    @timestamp, dimension and  _tsid fields, greatly reducing their on-disk 
    footprint.  LogsDB indexes default to using skippers in places of indexes 
    for their @timestamp and host.name fields.

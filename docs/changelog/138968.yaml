  title: New exponential_histogram field type for native OpenTelemetry exponential histogram support
  body: |-
    A new `exponential_histogram` field type has been added to Elasticsearch, providing native support for
    OpenTelemetry exponential histograms.

    Exponential histograms offer an efficient way to collect distributions (e.g. response times) at a high compression
    ratio while still maintaining good accuracy for percentile estimation. They can be easily collected via
    OpenTelemetry SDKs, as the only required configuration is the maximum allowed number of buckets. The actual buckets will be
    chosen automatically based on the observed values.

    The new `exponential_histogram` field type is supported in ES|QL.
    It can be aggregated using the `PERCENTILES`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` and `SUM` functions.

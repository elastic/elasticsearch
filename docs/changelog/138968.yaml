  title: New exponential_histogram field type for native OpenTelemetry exponential histogram support
  body: |-
    A new `exponential_histogram` field type has been added to Elasticsearch, providing native support for
    OpenTelemetry exponential histograms.

    Exponential histograms offer an efficient way to collect distributions (e.g. response times) at a high compression
    ratio while still maintaining good accuracy for percentile estimation. They can be easily collected via
    OpenTelemetry SDKs, as the only required configuration is a budget for the number of buckets. The actual buckets will be
    chosen automatically based on the observed values.

    The new `exponential_histogram` field type is supported in ES|QL, both in the `FROM` and `TS` source commands.
    It can be aggregated using the `PERCENTILES`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` and `SUM` functions.

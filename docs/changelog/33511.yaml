  title: Make Fuzziness reject illegal values earlier
  anchor: make_fuzziness_reject_illegal_values_earlier
  body: >-
    The current java implementation of Fuzziness leaves a lot of room for

    initializing it with illegal values that either cause errors later when the

    queries reach the shards where they are executed or values that are silently

    ignored in favour of defaults. We should instead tighten the java implementation

    of the class so that we only accept supported values. Currently those are

    numeric values representing the edit distances 0, 1 and 2, optionally also as

    float or string, and the "AUTO" fuzziness, which can come in a cusomizable

    variant that allows specifying two value that define the positions in a term

    where the AUTO option increases the allowed edit distance.

    This change removes several redundant ways of object construction and adds input

    validation to the remaining ones. Java users should either use one of the

    predefined constants or use the static factory methods fromEdits(int) or

    fromString(String) to create instances of the class, while other ctors are

    hidden. This allows for instance control, e.g. returning one of the constants

    when creating instances from an integer value.

    Previously the class would accept any positive integer value and any float

    value, while in effect the maximum allowed edit distance was capped at 2 in

    practice. These values while throw an error now, as will any other String value

    other than "AUTO" that where previously accepted but led to numeric exceptions

    when the query was executed.

  title: Make remote cluster resolution stricter
  anchor: make_remote_cluster_resolution_stricter
  body: >-
    Remote cluster resolution is currently lenient, to support local

    indices that may contain : in their name. From 8.0 on, there can no

    longer be indices in the cluster that contain : in their name, hence

    we can make remote cluster resolution stricter. Instead of treating

    as local any index expression containing a : whenever there is no corresponding

    matching remote cluster registered, we now throw a

    NoSuchRemoteClusterException.

    Closes #37863

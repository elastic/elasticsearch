  title: Error JSON structure has changed when detailed errors are disabled
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    This change modifies the JSON format of error messages returned to REST clients
    when detailed messages are turned off.
    Previously, JSON returned when an exception occurred, and `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` was set,
    just consisted of a single `"error"` text field with some basic information.
    Setting `http.detailed_errors.enabled: true` (the default) changed this field
    to an object with more detailed information.
    With this change, non-detailed errors now have the same structure as detailed errors. `"error"` will now always
    be an object with, at a minimum, a `"type"` and `"reason"` field. Additional fields are included when detailed
    errors are enabled.
    To use the previous structure for non-detailed errors, use the v8 REST API.
  impact: |-
    If you have set `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` (the default is `true`)
    the structure of JSON when any exceptions occur now matches the structure when
    detailed errors are enabled.
    To use the previous structure for non-detailed errors, use the v8 REST API.

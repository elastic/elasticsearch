  title: Asset tracking - geo_line in time-series aggregations
  body: |-
    The <<search-aggregations-metrics-geo-line,`geo_line` aggregation>> builds tracks from `geo_points`.
    It has previously needed to use large arrays in memory for collecting points into multiple buckets
    and sorting those buckets.

    With the advances made in TSDB features and the `time_series` aggregation in particular,
    it is now possible to rely on data aggregating in both TSID and timestamp order,
    enabling the removal of all sorting, as well as the use of only a single bucket's
    worth of memory, a dramatic improvement in memory footprint. In addition, we can use the streaming line
    simplifier algorithm introduced in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/94859 to replace the previous
    behaviour of truncating very large tracks with the far more preferable approach of simplifying those tracks.

  title: Remove the unused executor builder for vector tile plugin
  area: Geo
  details: The threadpool called `vectortile` is a left over from the original development of the vector tile search
           end point and it is used nowhere. It can still be a breaking change if it is configured on the
           elasticsearch yml file, for example by changing the threadpool size `thread_pool.vectortile.size=8`
  impact: In the case the threadpool appears on the yaml file, Elasticsearch will not start until those lines
          are removed.
  notable: false

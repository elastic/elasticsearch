  title: Switch TDigestState to use `HybridDigest` by default
  area: Aggregations
  details:
    The default implementation for TDigest in percentile calculations switches to a new internal implementation
    offering superior performance (2x-10x speedup), at a very small accuracy penalty for very large sample
    populations.

  impact:
    This change leads to generating slightly different results in percentile calculations. If the highest possible
    accuracy is desired, or it's crucial to produce exactly the same results as in previous versions, one can either
    set `"execution_hint": "high_accuracy"` in the `tdigest` spec of a given percentile calculation, or set
    `"search.aggs.tdigest_execution_hint": "high_accuracy"` in cluster settings to apply to all percentile queries.

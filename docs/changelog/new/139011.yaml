title: Add known issue for bbq_disk license check
description: The bbq_disk index format, licensed under the Enterprise subscription tier was introduced in 9.2.0 without appropriate license enforcement. This allowed users to create and use bbq_disk indices without an Enterprise license. This will be addressed in version 9.3.0. Upon upgrading to 9.3+ indices created on 9.2 will still be available for updates and queries, but new indices created on 9.3+ will require an Enterprise license.

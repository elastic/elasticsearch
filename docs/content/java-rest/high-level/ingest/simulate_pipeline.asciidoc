=== Simulate Pipeline API

[[java-rest-high-ingest-simulate-pipeline-request]]
==== Simulate Pipeline Request

A `SimulatePipelineRequest` requires a source and a `XContentType`. The source consists
of the request body. See the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/simulate-pipeline-api.html[docs]
for more details on the request body.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The request body as a `ByteArray`.
<2> The XContentType for the request body supplied above.

==== Optional arguments
The following arguments can optionally be provided:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-request-pipeline-id]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> You can either specify an existing pipeline to execute against the provided documents, or supply a
pipeline definition in the body of the request. This option sets the id for an existing pipeline.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-request-verbose]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> To see the intermediate results of each processor in the simulate request, you can add the verbose parameter
to the request.

[[java-rest-high-ingest-simulate-pipeline-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-execute]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Execute the request and get back the response in a `SimulatePipelineResponse` object.

[[java-rest-high-ingest-simulate-pipeline-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a simulate pipeline request requires both the `SimulatePipelineRequest`
instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed to the asynchronous
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `SimulatePipelineRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `SimulatePipelineResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-ingest-simulate-pipeline-response]]
==== Simulate Pipeline Response

The returned `SimulatePipelineResponse` allows to retrieve information about the executed
 operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[simulate-pipeline-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Get results for each of the documents provided as instance of `List<SimulateDocumentResult>`.
<2> If the request was in verbose mode cast the response to `SimulateDocumentVerboseResult`.
<3> Check the result after each processor is applied.
<4> Get the ingest document for the result obtained in 3.
<5> Or get the failure for the result obtained in 3.
<6> Get the result as `SimulateDocumentBaseResult` if the result was not verbose.
<7> Get the ingest document for the result obtained in 6.
<8> Or get the failure for the result obtained in 6.

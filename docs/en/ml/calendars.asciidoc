=== Calendars and Scheduled Events

Sometimes there are periods when you expect unusual activity to take place,
such as bank holidays, "Black Friday", or planned system outages. If you
identify these events in advance, no anomalies are generated during that period.
The {ml} model is not ill-affected and you do not receive spurious results.

You can create calendars and scheduled events in the **Settings** pane on the
**Machine Learning** page in {kib} or by using {ref}/ml-apis.html[{ml} APIs].

A scheduled event must have a start time, end time, and description. You can
identify zero or more scheduled events in a calendar. Jobs can then subscribe to
calendars and the {ml} analytics handle all subsequent scheduled events
appropriately.

If you want to add multiple scheduled events at once, you can import an
iCalendar (`.ics`) file in {kib} or a JSON file in the
//{ref}/ml-post-calendar-event.html[
add events to calendar API
//]
.

NOTE: Bucket results are generated during scheduled events but they have an
anomaly score of zero. For more information about bucket results, see
{ref}/ml-results-resource.html[Results Resources].

[[breaking-6.3.0-xes]]
== {xpack} Breaking changes in 6.3

This section summarizes the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to {xpack} 6.3.

Monitoring::
* By default when you install {xpack}, monitoring is enabled but data collection
is disabled. To enable data collection, use the new
`xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting. You can update this setting by
using the <<cluster-update-settings,Cluster Update Settings API>>. For more
information, see <<monitoring-settings>>.


Security::
* The legacy `XPackExtension` extension mechanism has been removed and replaced
with an SPI based extension mechanism that is installed and built as an
elasticsearch plugin.

[[breaking-6.0.0-xes]]
== {xpack} Breaking changes in 6.0

This section summarizes the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating

Security::
* A new bootstrap check enforces that default passwords are disabled for the
built-in users when running in
{ref}/bootstrap-checks.html#_development_vs_production_mode[production mode].
You must set `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` to `false` in your
`elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see <<security-settings>> and
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html[Setting Up User Authentication].
* A new configuration setting is available to disable support for the default
password (_"changeme"_). For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html#disabling-default-password[Disable Default Password Functionality].
* A new bootstrap check enforces that TLS/SSL is required for inter-node
communication when running in
{ref}/bootstrap-checks.html#_development_vs_production_mode[production mode]. See
{xpack-ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting Communications].

IMPORTANT: Before you start {es}, you must perform the steps described in
{xpack-ref}/ssl-tls.html[Setting up TLS/SSL on a cluster]. Otherwise, errors
occur at startup.

--
* A new bootstrap check enforces that HTTPS is used by the built-in token
service when running in
{ref}/bootstrap-checks.html#_development_vs_production_mode[production mode].
To disable the token service, set `xpack.security.authc.token.enabled`
to `false` in your `elasticsearch.yml`. See
{ref}/security-settings.html#token-service-settings[Token Service Settings].
* Suggesters can no longer be used if document level security is enabled.
The search request now fails with an error if suggesters are specified and
document level security is active.
* Query and aggregation profiling can no longer be used if document level
security is enabled. The search request now fails with an error if profiling
are enabled and document level security is active.

Watcher::
* The built-in HTTP client used in webhooks, the http input and the http email
attachment has been replaced.
This results in the need to always escape all parts of an URL.
* The new built-in HTTP client also enforces a maximum request size, which defaults to 10mb.
* The watch `_status` field has been renamed to `status`, as underscores in
field names will not be allowed.

Security::
* The fields returned as part of the mappings section by get index, get
mappings, get field mappings and field capabilities API are now only the ones
that the user is authorized to access in case field level security is enabled.

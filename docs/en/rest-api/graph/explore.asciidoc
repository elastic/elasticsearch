=== Explore API

The graph explore API ...

==== Request

`POST <index>/_xpack/graph/_explore`


==== Description

After an initial search users typically want to review the results using a form
of graph visualization tool like the one in the Kibana Graph UI. Users will
frequently then select one or more vertices of interest and ask to load more
vertices that may be connected to their current selection. In graph-speak,
this operation is often called _spidering_ or _spidering out_.

In order to spider out it is typically necessary to define two things:

 * The set of vertices from which you would like to spider
 * The set of vertices you already have in your workspace which you want to
   avoid seeing again in results

These two pieces of information when passed to the graph explore API will
ensure you are returned new vertices that can be attached to the existing
selection.

The `include`and `exclude` clauses provide the essential features that enable
clients to progressively build up a picture of related information in their
workspace. The `include` clause is used to define the set of start points from
which users wish to spider. Include clauses can also be used to limit the end
points users wish to reach, thereby "filling in" some of the missing links
between existing vertices in their client-side workspace. The `exclude` clause
can be used to avoid the Graph API returning vertices already visible in a
client's workspace or perhaps could list undesirable vertices that the client
has blacklisted from their workspace and never wants to see returned.

//==== Path Parameters

==== Request Body

connections::
  TBD. A list of fields is provided.
  query:::
    TBD. Optionally, a "guiding query" can be used to guide the API as it
    explores connected terms.
  vertices:::
    TBD.

NOTE: Further "connections" can be nested inside the "connections" object to
continue exploring out the relationships in the data. Each level of nesting is
commonly referred to as a "hop" and proximity in a graph is often thought of in
terms of "hop depth".

controls::
  TBD.
  use_significance:::
    TBD. The `use_significance` flag defaults to true and is used to filter
    associated terms to only those that are significantly associated with our
    query. The algorithm used to calculate significance are explained in the
    documentation for the
    {ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.html[significant_terms aggregation].

  sample_size:::
    TBD. Each "hop" considers a sample of the best-matching documents on each
    shard (default is 100 documents). Using samples has the dual benefit of
    keeping exploration focused on meaningfully-connected terms and improving
    the speed of execution. Very small values (less than 50) may not provide
    sufficient weight-of-evidence to identify significant connections between
    terms while very large sample sizes may dilute the quality and be slow.

  timeout:::
    TBD. A `timeout` setting (expressed here in milliseconds) after which
    exploration will be halted and results gathered so far are returned. This is
    a best-effort approach to termination so may overrun if, for example, a long
    pause is encountered while FieldData is loaded for a field.

  sample_diversity:::
    TBD. To avoid the top-matching documents sample being dominated by a single
    source of results sometimes it can prove necessary to request diversity in
    the sample. This is achieved by selecting a single-value field and a maximum
    number of documents per value in that field. In this example we are
    requiring that there are no more than 500 click documents from any one
    department in the store. This might help us consider products from the
    electronics, book and video departments whereas without this diversification
    our results may be entirely dominated by the electronics department.

query::
  TBD. A query is used to "seed" the exploration. Any of the usual {es} query
  syntax can be used here to identify the documents of interest.

vertices::
  TBD. A list of fields is provided.
  exclude:::
    TBD. The `exclude` clause avoids returning specific terms.
  field::: TBD
  include:::
    TBD. Lists the start points from which we want to spider using an `include`
    array of the terms of interest. Note that if you have an `include` clause,
    there is no need to define a seed query - we are implicitly querying for
    documents that contain any of the terms listed in our include clauses.
    Instead of passing plain strings in this array it is also possible to pass
    objects with `term` and `boost` values to boost matches on certain terms
    over others.
  size:::
    TBD. We can control the maximum number of vertex terms returned for each
    field using the `size` property. (Default is 5).
  min_doc_count:::
    TBD. This property acts as a certainty threshold - just how many documents
    have to contain a pair of terms before we consider this to be a useful
    connection? (Default is 3).
  shard_min_doc_count:::
    TBD. This is an advanced setting - just how many documents on a shard have
    to contain a pair of terms before we return this for global consideration?
    (Default is 2).

=== Delete {dfeeds-cap}

The delete {dfeed} API enables you to delete an existing {dfeed}.


==== Request

==== Description

NOTE: Unless the `force` parameter is used, the {dfeed} must be stopped before it can be deleted.


==== Path Parameters

`feed_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the {dfeed}


===== Query Parameters

`force`::
  (boolean) Use to forcefully delete a started {dfeed}; this method is quicker than

[[ml-jobcounts]]
==== Job Counts

The `data_counts` object provides information about the operational progress of a job.
It describes the number of records processed and any related error counts.

NOTE: Job count values are cumulative for the lifetime of a job. If a model snapshot is reverted
or old results are deleted, the job counts are not reset.

===== Data Counts Objects

A `data_counts` object has the following properties:

`job_id`::
  (+string+) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the job.

`processed_record_count`::
  (+long+) The number of records that have been processed by the job.
  This value includes records with missing fields, since they are nonetheless analyzed.
  The following records are not processed:
  * Records not in chronological order and outside the latency window
  * Records with invalid timestamps
  * Records filtered by an exclude transform

`processed_field_count`::
  (+long+) The total number of fields in all the records that have been processed by the job.
  Only fields that are specified in the detector configuration object contribute to this count.
  The time stamp is not included in this count.

`input_bytes`::
  (+long+) The number of raw bytes read by the job.

`input_field_count`::
  (+long+) The total number of record fields read by the job. This count includes
  fields that are not used in the analysis.

`invalid_date_count`::
  (+long+) The number of records with either a missing date field or a date that could not be parsed.

`missing_field_count`::
  (+long+) The number of records that are missing a field that the job is configured to analyze.
  Records with missing fields are still processed because it is possible that not all fields are missing.
  The value of `processed_record_count` includes this count.

`out_of_order_timestamp_count`::
  (+long+) The number of records that are out of time sequence and outside of the latency window.
  These records are discarded, since jobs require time series data to be in ascending chronological order.

`empty_bucket_count`::
  TBD

`sparse_bucket_count`::
  TBD

`bucket_count`::
  (+long+) The number of bucket results produced by the job.

`earliest_record_timestamp`::
  (+string+) The timestamp of the earliest chronologically ordered record.
  The datetime string is in ISO 8601 format.

`latest_record_timestamp`::
  (+string+) The timestamp of the last chronologically ordered record.
  If the records are not in strict chronological order, this value might not be
  the same as the timestamp of the last record.
  The datetime string is in ISO 8601 format.

`last_data_time`::
  TBD

`input_record_count`::
  (+long+) The number of data records read by the job.


[[ml-modelsizestats]]
===== Model Size Stats Objects

The `model_size_stats` object has the following properties:

`job_id`::
  (+string+) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the job.

`result_type`::
  TBD

`model_bytes`::
  (+long+) The number of bytes of memory used by the models. This is the maximum value since the
  last time the model was persisted. If the job is closed, this value indicates the latest size.

`total_by_field_count`::
  (+long+) The number of `by` field values that were analyzed by the models.

NOTE: The `by` field values are counted separately for each detector and partition.


`total_over_field_count`::
  (+long+) The number of `over` field values that were analyzed by the models.

NOTE: The `over` field values are counted separately for each detector and partition.

`total_partition_field_count`::
  (+long+) The number of `partition` field values that were analyzed by the models.

`bucket_allocation_failures_count`::
  TBD

`memory_status`::
  (+string+) The status of the mathematical models. This property can have one of the following values:
      "ok":: The models stayed below the configured value.
      "soft_limit":: The models used more than 60% of the configured memory limit and older unused models will
      be pruned to free up space.
      "hard_limit":: The models used more space than the configured memory limit. As a result,
      not all incoming data was processed.

`log_time`::
  TBD

`timestamp`::
  TBD

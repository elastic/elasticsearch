=== General Machine Learning Settings

`xpack.ml.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {ml}. +
+
If set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`, the {ml} APIs are disabled.
You also cannot open jobs or start data feeds.
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the {ml} icon is not visible in Kibana. +
+
TIP: If you want to use {ml} features in your cluster, you must enable {ml} on
all master-eligible nodes. This is the default behavior.

`node.ml`::
Set to `true` (default) to identify the node as a _machine learning node_. +
+
If set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`, the node cannot run jobs.
If you want to run jobs, there must be at least one machine learning node
in your cluster. +
+
TIP: On dedicated coordinating nodes or dedicated master nodes, disable
the `node.ml` role.

//Eventually this node information should be added to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.3/modules-node.html

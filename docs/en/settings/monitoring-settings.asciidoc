===  Monitoring Settings in Elasticsearch

<titleabbrev>Monitoring Settings</titleabbrev>

Monitoring is enabled by default when you install {xpack}. You can configure
these monitoring settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

To adjust how monitoring data is displayed in the monitoring UI, configure
{kibana-ref}/monitoring-settings-kb.html[`xpack.monitoring` settings] in
`kibana.yml`. To control how monitoring data is collected from
Logstash, configure {logstash-ref}/settings-xpack.html#monitoring-settings[
`xpack.monitoring` settings] in `logstash.yml`.

For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].

[float]
[[general-monitoring-settings]]
==== General Monitoring Settings
`xpack.monitoring.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable {es} {monitoring} for Elasticsearch.

[float]
[[monitoring-collection-settings]]
==== Monitoring Collection Settings

The `xpack.monitoring.collection` settings control how data is collected from
your Elasticsearch nodes.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.cluster.state.timeout`::

Sets the timeout for collecting the cluster state. Defaults to `10m`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.cluster.stats.timeout`::

Sets the timeout for collecting the cluster statistics. Defaults to `10m`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.indices`::

Controls which indices Monitoring collects data from. Defaults to all indices. Specify the index names
as a comma-separated list, for example `test1,test2,test3`. Names can include wildcards, for
example `test*`. You can explicitly include or exclude indices by prepending
`+` to include the index, or `-` to exclude the index. For example, to include all indices that
start with `test` except `test3`, you could specify `+test*,-test3`.
+
You can update this setting through the Cluster Update Settings API.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.index.stats.timeout`::

Sets the timeout for collecting index statistics. Defaults to `10m`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.indices.stats.timeout`::

Sets the timeout for collecting total indices statistics. Defaults to `10m`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.index.recovery.active_only`::

Controls whether or not all recoveries are collected. Set to `true` to
collect only active recoveries. Defaults to `false`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.index.recovery.timeout`::

Sets the timeout for collecting the recovery information. Defaults to `10m`.

`xpack.monitoring.collection.interval`::

Controls how often data samples are collected. Defaults to `10s`. If you
modify the collection interval, set the `xpack.monitoring.min_interval_seconds`
option in `kibana.yml` to the same value. Set to `-1` to temporarily disable
data collection. You can update this setting through the Cluster Update
Settings API.

`xpack.monitoring.history.duration`::

Sets the retention duration beyond which the indices created by a Monitoring exporter will
be automatically deleted. Defaults to `7d` (7 days).
+
This setting has a minimum value of `1d` (1 day) to ensure that something is being monitored,
and it cannot be disabled.
+
IMPORTANT: This setting currently only impacts `local`-type exporters. Indices created using
the `http` exporter will not be deleted automatically.

`xpack.monitoring.exporters`::

Configures where the agent stores monitoring data. By default, the agent uses a
local exporter that indexes monitoring data on the cluster where it is installed.
Use an HTTP exporter to send data to a separate monitoring cluster. For more
information, see <<local-exporter-settings,Local Exporter Settings>>,
<<http-exporter-settings,HTTP Exporter Settings>>, and
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-cluster.html[Setting up a Separate Monitoring Cluster].

[float]
[[local-exporter-settings]]
==== Local Exporter Settings

The `local` exporter is the default exporter used by Monitoring. As the name is
meant to imply, it exports data to the _local_ cluster, which means that there
is not much needed to be configured.

If you do not supply _any_ exporters, then Monitoring will automatically create
one for you. If any exporter is provided, then no default is added.

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters.my_local:
  type: local
----------------------------------

`type`::

The value for a Local exporter must always be `local` and it is required.

`use_ingest`::

Whether to supply a placeholder pipeline to the cluster and a pipeline processor with
every bulk request. The default value is `true`. If disabled, then it means that it will not
use pipelines, which means that a future release cannot automatically upgrade bulk requests
to future-proof them.

`cluster_alerts.management.enabled`::

Whether to create cluster alerts for this cluster. The default value is `true`.
To use this feature, {watcher} must be enabled.  If you have a basic license,
cluster alerts are not displayed.

[float]
[[http-exporter-settings]]
==== HTTP Exporter Settings

The following lists settings that can be supplied with the `http` exporter.
All settings are shown as what follows the name you select for your exporter:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters.my_remote:
  type: http
  host: ["host:port", ...]
----------------------------------

`type`::

The value for an HTTP exporter must always be `http` and it is required.

`host`::

Host supports multiple formats, both as an array or as a single value. Supported formats include
`hostname`, `hostname:port`, `http://hostname` `http://hostname:port`, `https://hostname`, and
`https://hostname:port`. Hosts cannot be assumed. The default scheme is always `http` and the default
port is always `9200` if not supplied as part of the `host` string.
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  example1:
    type: http
    host: "10.1.2.3"
  example2:
    type: http
    host: ["http://10.1.2.4"]
  example3:
    type: http
    host: ["10.1.2.5", "10.1.2.6"]
  example4:
    type: http
    host: ["https://10.1.2.3:9200"]
----------------------------------

`auth.username`::

The username is required if a `auth.password` is supplied.

`auth.password`::

The password for the `auth.username`.

`connection.timeout`::

The amount of time that the HTTP connection is supposed to wait for a socket to open for the
request. The default value is `6s`.

`connection.read_timeout`::

The amount of time that the HTTP connection is supposed to wait for a socket to
send back a response. The default value is `10 * connection.timeout` (`60s` if neither are set).

`ssl`::

Each HTTP exporter can define its own TLS / SSL settings or inherit them. See the
<<ssl-monitoring-settings, TLS / SSL section below>>.

`proxy.base_path`::

The base path to prefix any outgoing request, such as `/base/path` (e.g., bulk requests would
then be sent as `/base/path/_bulk`). There is no default value.

`headers`::

Optional headers that are added to every request, which can assist with routing requests through
proxies.
+
[source,yaml]
----------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.exporters.my_remote:
  headers:
    X-My-Array: [abc, def, xyz]
    X-My-Header: abc123
----------------------------------
+
Array-based headers are sent `n` times where `n` is the size of the array. `Content-Type`
and `Content-Length` cannot be set. Any headers created by the Monitoring agent will override
anything defined here.

`index.name.time_format`::

A mechanism for changing the default date suffix for the, by default, daily Monitoring indices.
The default value is `YYYY.MM.DD`, which is why the indices are created daily.

`use_ingest`::

Whether to supply a placeholder pipeline to the monitoring cluster and a pipeline processor with
every bulk request. The default value is `true`. If disabled, then it means that it will not
use pipelines, which means that a future release cannot automatically upgrade bulk requests
to future-proof them.

`cluster_alerts.management.enabled`::

Whether to create cluster alerts for this cluster. The default value is `true`.
To use this feature, {watcher} must be enabled.  If you have a basic license,
cluster alerts are not displayed.

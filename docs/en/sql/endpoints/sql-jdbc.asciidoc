== SQL JDBC

Elasticsearch's SQL jdbc driver is a fully featured JDBC driver
for Elasticsearch. You can connect to it using the two APIs offered
by JDBC, namely `java.sql.Driver` and `DriverManager`:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/JdbcIntegrationTestCase.java[connect-dm]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. The port is usually 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

or `javax.sql.DataSource` through 
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. The port is usually 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

Which one to use? Typically client applications that provide most
configuration parameters in the URL rely on the `DriverManager`-style
while `DataSource` is preferred when being _passed_ around since it can be
configured in one place and the consumer only has to call `getConnection`
without having to worry about any other parameters.

To connect to a secured Elasticsearch server the `Properties`
should look like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{security-tests}/JdbcSecurityIT.java[admin_properties]
--------------------------------------------------

Once you have the connection you can use it like any other JDBC
connection. For example:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/SimpleExampleTestCase.java[simple_example]
--------------------------------------------------

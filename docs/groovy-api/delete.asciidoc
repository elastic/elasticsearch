== Delete API

The delete API is very similar to the
// {javaclient}/java-docs-delete.html[]
Java delete API, here is an
example:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------
def deleteF = node.client.delete {
    index "test"
    type "type1"
    id "1"
}
--------------------------------------------------

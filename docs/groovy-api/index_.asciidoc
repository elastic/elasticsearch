[[index_]]
== Index API

The index API is very similar to the
// {javaclient}/java-docs-index.html[]
Java index API. The Groovy
extension to it is the ability to provide the indexed source using a
closure. For example:

[source,groovy]
--------------------------------------------------
def indexR = client.index {
    index "test"
    type "type1"
    id "1"
    source {
        test = "value"
        complex {
            value1 = "value1"
            value2 = "value2"
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

In the above example, the source closure itself gets transformed into an
XContent (defaults to JSON). In order to change how the source closure
is serialized, a global (static) setting can be set on the `GClient` by
changing the `indexContentType` field.

Note also that the `source` can be set using the typical Java based
APIs, the `Closure` option is a Groovy extension.

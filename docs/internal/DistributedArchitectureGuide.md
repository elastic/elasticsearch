# Distributed Area Internals

The Distributed Area contains indexing and coordination systems.

The index path stretches from the user REST command through shard routing down to each individual shard's translog and storage
engine. Reindexing is effectively reading from a source index and writing to a destination index (perhaps on different nodes).
The coordination side includes cluster coordination, shard allocation, cluster autoscaling stats, task management, and cross
cluster replication. Less obvious coordination systems include networking, the discovery plugin system, the snapshot/restore
logic, and shard recovery.

A guide to the general Elasticsearch components can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/internal/GeneralArchitectureGuide.md).

# Networking

### ThreadPool

(We have many thread pools, what and why)

### ActionListener

See the [Javadocs for `ActionListener`](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/ActionListener.java)

(TODO: add useful starter references and explanations for a range of Listener classes. Reference the Netty section.)

### REST Layer

The REST and Transport layers are bound together through the `ActionModule`. `ActionModule#initRestHandlers` registers all the
rest actions with a `RestController` that matches incoming requests to particular REST actions. `RestController#registerHandler`
uses each `Rest*Action`'s `#routes()` implementation to match HTTP requests to that particular `Rest*Action`. Typically, REST
actions follow the class naming convention `Rest*Action`, which makes them easier to find, but not always; the `#routes()`
definition can also be helpful in finding a REST action. `RestController#dispatchRequest` eventually calls `#handleRequest` on a
`RestHandler` implementation. `RestHandler` is the base class for `BaseRestHandler`, which most `Rest*Action` instances extend to
implement a particular REST action.

`BaseRestHandler#handleRequest` calls into `BaseRestHandler#prepareRequest`, which children `Rest*Action` classes extend to
define the behavior for a particular action. `RestController#dispatchRequest` passes a `RestChannel` to the `Rest*Action` via
`RestHandler#handleRequest`: `Rest*Action#prepareRequest` implementations return a `RestChannelConsumer` defining how to execute
the action and reply on the channel (usually in the form of completing an ActionListener wrapper). `Rest*Action#prepareRequest`
implementations are responsible for parsing the incoming request, and verifying that the structure of the request is valid.
`BaseRestHandler#handleRequest` will then check that all the request parameters have been consumed: unexpected request parameters
result in an error.

### How REST Actions Connect to Transport Actions

The Rest layer uses an implementation of `AbstractClient`. `BaseRestHandler#prepareRequest` takes a `NodeClient`: this client
knows how to connect to a specified TransportAction. A `Rest*Action` implementation will return a `RestChannelConsumer` that
most often invokes a call into a method on the `NodeClient` to pass through to the TransportAction. Along the way from
`BaseRestHandler#prepareRequest` through the `AbstractClient` and `NodeClient` code, `NodeClient#executeLocally` is called: this
method calls into `TaskManager#registerAndExecute`, registering the operation with the `TaskManager` so it can be found in Task
API requests, before moving on to execute the specified TransportAction.

`NodeClient` has a `NodeClient#actions` map from `ActionType` to `TransportAction`. `ActionModule#setupActions` registers all the
core TransportActions, as well as those defined in any plugins that are being used: plugins can override `Plugin#getActions()` to
define additional TransportActions. Note that not all TransportActions will be mapped back to a REST action: many TransportActions
are only used for internode operations/communications.

### Transport Layer

(Managed by the TransportService, TransportActions must be registered there, too)

(Executing a TransportAction (either locally via NodeClient or remotely via TransportService) is where most of the authorization & other security logic runs)

(What actions, and why, are registered in TransportService but not NodeClient?)

### Direct Node to Node Transport Layer

(TransportService maps incoming requests to TransportActions)

### Chunk Encoding

#### XContent

### Performance

### Netty

(long running actions should be forked off of the Netty thread. Keep short operations to avoid forking costs)

### Work Queues

### RestClient

The `RestClient` is primarily used in testing, to send requests against cluster nodes in the same format as would users. There
are some uses of `RestClient`, via `RestClientBuilder`, in the production code. For example, remote reindex leverages the
`RestClient` internally as the REST client to the remote elasticsearch cluster, and to take advantage of the compatibility of
`RestClient` requests with much older elasticsearch versions. The `RestClient` is also used externally by the `Java API Client`
to communicate with Elasticsearch.

# Cluster Coordination

(Sketch of important classes? Might inform more sections to add for details.)

(A NodeB can coordinate a search across several other nodes, when NodeB itself does not have the data, and then return a result to the caller. Explain this coordinating role)

### Node Roles

### Master Nodes

### Master Elections

(Quorum, terms, any eligibility limitations)

### Cluster Formation / Membership

(Explain joining, and how it happens every time a new master is elected)

#### Discovery

### Master Transport Actions

### Cluster State

#### Master Service

#### Cluster State Publication

(Majority concensus to apply, what happens if a master-eligible node falls behind / is incommunicado.)

#### Cluster State Application

(Go over the two kinds of listeners -- ClusterStateApplier and ClusterStateListener?)

#### Persistence

(Sketch ephemeral vs persisted cluster state.)

(what's the format for persisted metadata)

# Replication

(More Topics: ReplicationTracker concepts / highlights.)

### What is a Shard

### Primary Shard Selection

(How a primary shard is chosen)

#### Versioning

(terms and such)

### How Data Replicates

(How an index write replicates across shards -- TransportReplicationAction?)

### Consistency Guarantees

(What guarantees do we give the user about persistence and readability?)

# Locking

(rarely use locks)

### ShardLock

### Translog / Engine Locking

### Lucene Locking

# Engine

(What does Engine mean in the distrib layer? Distinguish Engine vs Directory vs Lucene)

(High level explanation of how translog ties in with Lucene)

(contrast Lucene vs ES flush / refresh / fsync)

### Refresh for Read

(internal vs external reader manager refreshes? flush vs refresh)

### Reference Counting

### Store

(Data lives beyond a high level IndexShard instance. Continue to exist until all references to the Store go away, then Lucene data is removed)

### Translog

(Explain checkpointing and generations, when happens on Lucene flush / fsync)

(Concurrency control for flushing)

(VersionMap)

#### Translog Truncation

#### Direct Translog Read

### Index Version

### Lucene

(copy a sketch of the files Lucene can have here and explain)

(Explain about SearchIndexInput -- IndexWriter, IndexReader -- and the shared blob cache)

(Lucene uses Directory, ES extends/overrides the Directory class to implement different forms of file storage.
Lucene contains a map of where all the data is located in files and offsites, and fetches it from various files.
ES doesn't just treat Lucene as a storage engine at the bottom (the end) of the stack. Rather ES has other information that
works in parallel with the storage engine.)

#### Segment Merges

# Recovery

(All shards go through a 'recovery' process. Describe high level. createShard goes through this code.)

(How is the translog involved in recovery?)

### Create a Shard

### Local Recovery

### Peer Recovery

### Snapshot Recovery

### Recovery Across Server Restart

(partial shard recoveries survive server restart? `reestablishRecovery`? How does that work.)

### How a Recovery Method is Chosen

# Data Tiers

(Frozen, warm, hot, etc.)

# Allocation

(AllocationService runs on the master node)

(Discuss different deciders that limit allocation. Sketch / list the different deciders that we have.)

### APIs for Balancing Operations

(Significant internal APIs for balancing a cluster)

### Heuristics for Allocation

### Cluster Reroute Command

(How does this command behave with the desired auto balancer.)

# Autoscaling

The Autoscaling API in ES (Elasticsearch) uses cluster and node level statistics to provide a recommendation
for a cluster size to support the current cluster data and active workloads. ES Autoscaling is paired
with an ES Cloud service that periodically polls the ES elected master node for suggested cluster
changes. The cloud service will add more resources to the cluster based on Elasticsearch's recommendation.
Elasticsearch by itself cannot automatically scale.

Autoscaling recommendations are tailored for the user [based on user defined policies][], composed of data
roles (hot, frozen, etc.) and [deciders][]. There's a public [webinar on autoscaling][], as well as the
public [Autoscaling APIs] docs.

Autoscaling's current implementation is based primary on storage requirements, as well as memory capacity
for ML and frozen tier. It does not yet support scaling related to search load. Paired with ES Cloud,
autoscaling only scales upward, not downward, except for ML nodes that do get scaled up _and_ down.

[Autoscaling APIs]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/autoscaling-apis.html

### Plugin REST and TransportAction entrypoints

Autoscaling is a [plugin][]. All the REST APIs can be found in [autoscaling/rest/][].
`GetAutoscalingCapacityAction` is the capacity calculation operation REST endpoint, as opposed to the
other rest commands that get/set/delete the policies guiding the capacity calculation. The Transport
Actions can be found in [autoscaling/action/], where [TransportGetAutoscalingCapacityAction][] is the
entrypoint on the master node for calculating the optimal cluster resources based on the autoscaling
policies.

### How cluster capacity is determined

[AutoscalingMetadata][] implements [Metadata.Custom][] in order to persist autoscaling policies. Each
Decider is an implementation of [AutoscalingDeciderService][]. The [AutoscalingCalculateCapacityService][]
is responsible for running the calculation.

[TransportGetAutoscalingCapacityAction.computeCapacity] is the entry point to [AutoscalingCalculateCapacityService.calculate],
which creates a [AutoscalingDeciderResults][] for [each autoscaling policy][]. [AutoscalingDeciderResults.toXContent][] then
determines the [maximum required capacity][] to return to the caller. [AutoscalingCapacity][] is the base unit of a cluster
resources recommendation.

The `TransportGetAutoscalingCapacityAction` response is cached to prevent concurrent callers
overloading the system: the operation is expensive. `TransportGetAutoscalingCapacityAction` contains
a [CapacityResponseCache][]. `TransportGetAutoscalingCapacityAction.masterOperation`
calls [through the CapacityResponseCache][], into the `AutoscalingCalculateCapacityService`, to handle
concurrent callers.

### Where the data comes from

The Deciders each pull data from different sources as needed to inform their decisions. The
[DiskThresholdMonitor][] is one such data source. The Monitor runs on the master node and maintains
lists of nodes that exceed various disk size thresholds. [DiskThresholdSettings][] contains the
threshold settings with which the `DiskThresholdMonitor` runs.

[DiskThresholdMonitor]: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v8.13.2/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/allocation/DiskThresholdMonitor.java#L53-L58
[DiskThresholdSettings]: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v8.13.2/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/routing/allocation/DiskThresholdSettings.java#L24-L27

### Deciders

The `ReactiveStorageDeciderService` tracks information that demonstrates storage limitations are causing
problems in the cluster. It uses [an algorithm defined here][]. Some examples are
- information from the `DiskThresholdMonitor` to find out whether nodes are exceeding their storage capacity
- number of unassigned shards that failed allocation because of insufficient storage
- the max shard size and minimum node size, and whether these can be satisfied with the existing infrastructure

[an algorithm defined here]: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v8.13.2/x-pack/plugin/autoscaling/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/autoscaling/storage/ReactiveStorageDeciderService.java#L158-L176

The `ProactiveStorageDeciderService` maintains a forecast window that [defaults to 30 minutes][]. It only
runs on data streams (ILM, rollover, etc.), not regular indexes. It looks at past [index changes][] that
took place within the forecast window to [predict][] resources that will be needed shortly.

There are several more Decider Services, implementing the `AutoscalingDeciderService` interface.

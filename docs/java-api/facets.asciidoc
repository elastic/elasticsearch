== Facets

Faceted search refers to a way to explore large amounts of data by displaying
summaries about various partitions of the data and later allowing to narrow
the navigation to a specific partition.

In Elasticsearch, `facets` are also the name of a feature that allowed to
compute these summaries. `facets` have been replaced by
<<java-aggs, aggregations>> in Elasticsearch 1.0, which are a superset
of facets.

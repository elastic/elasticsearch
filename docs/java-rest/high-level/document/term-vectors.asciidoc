[id="{upid}-{api}"]
=== Term Vectors API

Term Vectors API returns information and statistics on terms in the fields
of a particular document. The document could be stored in the index or
artificially provided by the user.


[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Term Vectors Request

A +{request}+ expects an `index` and an `id` to specify
a certain document, and fields for which the information is retrieved.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------

Term vectors can also be generated for artificial documents, that is for
documents not present in the index:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request-artificial]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> An artificial document is provided as an `XContentBuilder` object,
the Elasticsearch built-in helper to generate JSON content.

===== Optional arguments

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request-optional-arguments]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Set `fieldStatistics` to `false` (default is `true`) to omit document count,
sum of document frequencies, sum of total term frequencies.
<2> Set `termStatistics` to `true` (default is `false`) to display
total term frequency and document frequency.
<3> Set `positions` to `false` (default is `true`) to omit the output of
positions.
<4> Set `offsets` to `false` (default is `true`) to omit the output of
offsets.
<5> Set `payloads` to `false` (default is `true`) to omit the output of
payloads.
<6> Set `filterSettings` to filter the terms that can be returned based
on their tf-idf scores.
<7> Set `perFieldAnalyzer` to specify  a different analyzer than
the one that the field has.
<8> Set `realtime` to `false` (default is `true`) to retrieve term vectors
near realtime.
<9> Set a routing parameter

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Term Vectors Response

+{response}+ contains the following information:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The index name of the document.
<2> The id of the document.
<3> Indicates whether or not the document found.


===== Inspecting Term Vectors
If +{response}+ contains non-null list of term vectors,
more information about each term vector can be obtained using the following:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-term-vectors]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The name of the current field
<2> Fields statistics for the current field - document count
<3> Fields statistics for the current field - sum of total term frequencies
<4> Fields statistics for the current field - sum of document frequencies
<5> Terms for the current field
<6> The name of the term
<7> Term frequency of the term
<8> Document frequency of the term
<9> Total term frequency of the term
<10> Score of the term
<11> Tokens of the term
<12> Position of the token
<13> Start offset of the token
<14> End offset of the token
<15> Payload of the token

=== Create or update pipeline API

[[java-rest-high-ingest-put-pipeline-request]]
==== Request

A `PutPipelineRequest` requires an `id` argument, a source and a `XContentType`. The source consists
of a description and a list of `Processor` objects.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The pipeline id
<2> The source for the pipeline as a `ByteArray`.
<3> The XContentType for the pipeline source supplied above.

==== Optional arguments
The following arguments can optionally be provided:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-request-timeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the pipeline creation as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the pipeline creation as a `String`

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-request-masterTimeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `String`

[[java-rest-high-ingest-put-pipeline-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-execute]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Execute the request and get back the response in a WritePipelineResponse object.

[[java-rest-high-ingest-put-pipeline-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a create or update pipeline request requires both
the `PutPipelineRequest` instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed
to the asynchronous method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `PutPipelineRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `WritePipelineResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-ingest-put-pipeline-response]]
==== Response

The returned `WritePipelineResponse` allows to retrieve information about the executed
 operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IngestClientDocumentationIT.java[put-pipeline-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Indicates whether all of the nodes have acknowledged the request

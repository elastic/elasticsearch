=== Start Basic License

[[java-rest-high-start-basic-execution]]
==== Execution

This API creates and enables a basic license using the `startBasic()` method.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[start-basic-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-start-basic-response]]
==== Response

The returned `StartBasicResponse` returns a field indicating whether the
basic was started. If it was started, the response returns a the type of
license started. If it was not started, it returns an error message describing
why.

Acknowledgement messages may also be returned if this API was called without
the `acknowledge` flag set to `true`. In this case you need to display the
messages to the end user and if they agree, resubmit the request with the
`acknowledge` flag set to `true`. Please note that the response will still
return a 200 return code even if it requires an acknowledgement. So, it is
necessary to check the `acknowledged` flag.

--------------------------------------------------
<1> Whether or not the request had the `acknowledge` flag set
<2> Whether or not this request caused a basic to start
<3> If this request did not cause a basic to start, a message explaining why
<4> If the user's request did not have the `acknowledge` flag set, a summary
of the user's acknowledgement required for this API
<5> If the user's request did not have the `acknowledge` flag set, contains
keys of commercial features and values of messages describing how they will
be affected by licensing changes as the result of starting a basic

[[java-rest-high-start-basic-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[start-basic-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `StartBasicResponse` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `StartBasicResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/LicensingDocumentationIT.java[start-basic-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

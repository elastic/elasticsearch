=== Forecast Job API

The Forecast Job API provides the ability to forecast a {ml} job's behavior based
on historical data.
It accepts a +{request}+ object and responds
with a +{response}+ object.

A +{request}+ object gets created with an existing non-null `jobId`.
All other fields are optional for the request.

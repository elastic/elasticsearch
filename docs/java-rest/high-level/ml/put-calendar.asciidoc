=== Put Calendar API
Creates a new {ml} calendar.
The API accepts a `PutCalendarRequest` and responds
with a `PutCalendarResponse` object.

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-get-calendars-request]]
==== Put Calendar Request

A `PutCalendarRequest` is constructed with a Calendar object

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-put-calendar-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Create a request with the given Calendar


[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-put-calendar-response]]
==== Put Calendar Response

The returned `PutCalendarResponse` contains the created Calendar:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-put-calendar-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The created Calendar

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-put-calendar-execution]]
==== Execution
The request can be executed through the `MachineLearningClient` contained
in the `RestHighLevelClient` object, accessed via the `machineLearningClient()` method.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-put-calendar-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-put-calendar-execution-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The request can also be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-put-calendar-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `PutCalendarResquest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back with the `onResponse` method
if the execution is successful or the `onFailure` method if the execution
failed.

A typical listener for `PutCalendarResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-put-calendar-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `onResponse` is called back when the action is completed successfully
<2> `onFailure` is called back when some unexpected error occurs

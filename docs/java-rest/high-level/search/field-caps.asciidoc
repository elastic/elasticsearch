=== Field Capabilities API

The field capabilities API allows for retrieving the capabilities of fields across multiple indices.

[[java-rest-high-field-caps-request]]
==== Field Capabilities Request

A `FieldCapabilitiesRequest` contains a list of fields to get capabilities for,
plus an optional list of target indices. If no indices are provided, the request
runs on all indices.

Note that fields parameter supports wildcard notation. For example, providing `text_*`
will cause all fields that match the expression to be returned.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-request]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-field-caps-request-optional]]
===== Optional arguments

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-request-indicesOptions]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting `IndicesOptions` controls how unavailable indices are resolved and
how wildcard expressions are expanded.

[[java-rest-high-field-caps-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

The `fieldCaps` method executes the request synchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-field-caps-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The `fieldCapsAsync` method executes the request asynchronously,
calling the provided `ActionListener` when the response is ready:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `FieldCapabilitiesRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes.

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once the request
completes, the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `FieldCapabilitiesResponse` is constructed as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed.
<2> Called when the whole `FieldCapabilitiesRequest` fails.

[[java-rest-high-field-caps-response]]
==== FieldCapabilitiesResponse

For each requested field, the returned `FieldCapabilitiesResponse` contains its type
and whether or not it can be searched or aggregated on. The response also gives
information about how each index contributes to the field's capabilities.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SearchDocumentationIT.java[field-caps-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> A map with entries for the field's possible types, in this case `keyword` and `text`.
<2> All indices where the `user` field has type `keyword`.
<3> The subset of these indices where the `user` field isn't searchable, or null if it's always searchable.
<4> Another subset of these indices where the `user` field isn't aggregatable, or null if it's always aggregatable.

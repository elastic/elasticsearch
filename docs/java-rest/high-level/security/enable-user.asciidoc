=== Enable User API

[[java-rest-high-security-enable-user-execution]]
==== Execution

Enabling a disabled user can be performed using the `security().enableUser()`
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[enable-user-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-security-enable-user-response]]
==== Response

The returned `Boolean` indicates the request status.

[[java-rest-high-security-enable-user-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[enable-user-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `EnableUser` request to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes.

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once the request
has completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for a `Boolean` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[enable-user-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument.
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument.

=== Create or update role mapping API

[[java-rest-high-security-put-role-mapping-execution]]
==== Execution

Creating and updating a role mapping can be performed using the `security().putRoleMapping()`
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[put-role-mapping-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-security-put-role-mapping-response]]
==== Response

The returned `PutRoleMappingResponse` contains a single field, `created`. This field
serves as an indication if a role mapping was created or if an existing entry was updated.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[put-role-mapping-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `created` is a boolean indicating whether the role mapping was created or updated

[[java-rest-high-security-put-role-mapping-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously using the `security().putRoleMappingAsync()`
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[put-role-mapping-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `PutRoleMappingRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once the request
has completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for a `PutRoleMappingResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[put-role-mapping-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

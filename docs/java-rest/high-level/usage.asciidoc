=== Getting started

[[java-rest-high-usage-maven]]
==== Maven Repository

The high-level Java REST client is hosted on
http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.elasticsearch.client%22[Maven
Central]. The minimum Java version required is `1.8`.

The high-level REST client is subject to the same release cycle as
elasticsearch. Replace the version with the desired client version, first
released with `5.x.x`. There is no relation between the client version
and the elasticsearch version that the client can communicate with as
it depends on the <<java-rest-low>> which is compatible with all elasticsearch versions.

===== Maven configuration

Here is how you can configure the dependency using maven as a dependency manager.
Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

["source","xml",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.elasticsearch.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-high-level</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-usage-maven-gradle]]
===== Gradle configuration

Here is how you can configure the dependency using gradle as a dependency manager.
Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

["source","groovy",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------------
dependencies {
    compile 'org.elasticsearch.client:rest-high-level:{version}'
}
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-usage-dependencies]]
==== Dependencies

The high-level Java REST client depends on the following artifacts and their
transitive dependencies:

- org.elasticsearch.client:rest
- org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch


[[java-rest-high-usage-initialization]]
==== Initialization

A `RestHighLevelClient` instance needs a <<java-rest-low-usage-initialization,REST low-level client>>
to be built as follows:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
RestHighLevelClient client =
    new RestHighLevelClient(lowLevelRestClient); <1>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> We pass the <<java-rest-low-usage-initialization,REST low-level client>> instance

In the rest of this documentation about the high-level client, the `RestHighLevelClient` instance
will be referenced as `client`.

Then you have access to the high level APIs such as:

include::apis.asciidoc[]

Each API comes with 2 ways of executing it:

* Synchronously, for example method <<java-rest-high-document-delete,`delete`>>

* Asynchronously which has `Async` added to the synchronous method name. Like
<<java-rest-high-document-delete,`deleteAsync`>>. In which case you will have to
provide a listener.

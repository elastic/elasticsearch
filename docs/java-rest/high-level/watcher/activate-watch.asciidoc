[id="{upid}-{api}"]
=== Activate watch API

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Execution

A watch can be activated as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Response

The returned +{response}+ contains the new status of the activated watch.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `watchStatus` contains status of the watch

[id="{upid}-{api}-request-async"]
==== Asynchronous execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The +{request}+ to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for +{response}+ looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

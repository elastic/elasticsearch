=== Delete watch API

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-watcher-delete-watch-execution]]
==== Execution

A watch can be deleted as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-watch-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-watcher-delete-watch-response]]
==== Response

The returned `DeleteWatchResponse` contains `found`, `id`,
and `version` information.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-put-watch-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `_id` contains id of the watch
<2> `found` is a boolean indicating whether the watch was found
<3> `_version` returns the version of the deleted watch

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-watcher-delete-watch-async]]
==== Asynchronous execution

This request can be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-watch-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteWatchRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `DeleteWatchResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/WatcherDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-delete-watch-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

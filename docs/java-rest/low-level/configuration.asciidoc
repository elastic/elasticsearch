== Common configuration

As explained in <<java-rest-low-usage-initialization>>, the `RestClientBuilder`
supports providing both a `RequestConfigCallback` and an `HttpClientConfigCallback`
which allow for any customization that the Apache Async Http Client exposes.
Those callbacks make it possible to modify some specific behaviour of the client
without overriding every other default configuration that the `RestClient`
is initialized with. This section describes some common scenarios that require
additional configuration for the low-level Java REST Client.

=== Timeouts

Configuring requests timeouts can be done by providing an instance of
`RequestConfigCallback` while building the `RestClient` through its builder.
The interface has one method that receives an instance of
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/client/config/RequestConfig.Builder.html[`org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig.Builder`]
 as an argument and has the same return type. The request config builder can
be modified and then returned. In the following example we increase the
connect timeout (defaults to 1 second) and the socket timeout (defaults to 30
seconds). Also we adjust the max retry timeout accordingly (defaults to 30
seconds too).

--------------------------------------------------

=== Number of threads

The Apache Http Async Client starts by default one dispatcher thread, and a
number of worker threads used by the connection manager, as many as the number
of locally detected processors (depending on what
`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` returns). The number of threads
can be modified as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RestClientDocumentation.java[rest-client-config-threads]
--------------------------------------------------

=== Basic authentication

Configuring basic authentication can be done by providing an
`HttpClientConfigCallback` while building the `RestClient` through its builder.
The interface has one method that receives an instance of
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-dev/httpasyncclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/impl/nio/client/HttpAsyncClientBuilder.html[`org.apache.http.impl.nio.client.HttpAsyncClientBuilder`]
 as an argument and has the same return type. The http client builder can be
modified and then returned. In the following example we set a default
credentials provider that requires basic authentication.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RestClientDocumentation.java[rest-client-config-basic-auth]
--------------------------------------------------

Preemptive Authentication can be disabled, which means that every request will be sent without
authorization headers to see if it is accepted and, upon receiving a HTTP 401 response, it will
resend the exact same request with the basic authentication header. If you wish to do this, then
you can do so by disabling it via the `HttpAsyncClientBuilder`:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RestClientDocumentation.java[rest-client-config-disable-preemptive-auth]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Disable preemptive authentication

=== Encrypted communication

Encrypted communication can also be configured through the
`HttpClientConfigCallback`. The
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-dev/httpasyncclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/impl/nio/client/HttpAsyncClientBuilder.html[`org.apache.http.impl.nio.client.HttpAsyncClientBuilder`]
 received as an argument exposes multiple methods to configure encrypted
 communication: `setSSLContext`, `setSSLSessionStrategy` and
 `setConnectionManager`, in order of precedence from the least important.
 The following is an example:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/RestClientDocumentation.java[rest-client-config-encrypted-communication]
--------------------------------------------------

If no explicit configuration is provided, the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CustomizingStores[system default configuration]
will be used.

=== Others

For any other required configuration needed, the Apache HttpAsyncClient docs
should be consulted: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-4.1.x/ .

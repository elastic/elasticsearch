== Painless contexts

A Painless script is evaluated within a context. Each context has values that
are available as local variables, a whitelist that controls the available
classes, and the methods and fields within those classes (API), and
if and what type of value is returned.

A Painless script is typically executed within one of the contexts in the table
below. Note this is not necessarily a comprehensive list as custom plugins and
specialized code may define new ways to use a Painless script.

=== Minimum should match context

Use a Painless script to specify the
{ref}/query-dsl-terms-set-query.html[minimum] number of terms that a
specified field needs to match with for a document to be part of the query
results.

*Variables*

`params` (`Map`, read-only)::
        User-defined parameters passed in as part of the query.

`params['num_terms']` (`int`, read-only)::
        The number of terms specified to match with.

`doc` (`Map`, read-only)::
        Contains the fields of the current document where each field is a
        `List` of values.

*Return*

`int`::
        The minimum number of terms required to match the current document.

*API*

The standard <<painless-api-reference-shared, Painless API>> is available.

*Example*

To run this example, first follow the steps in
<<painless-context-examples, context examples>>.

Imagine that you want to find seats to performances by your favorite
actors. You have a list of favorite actors in mind, and you want
to find performances where the cast includes at least a certain
number of them. `terms_set` query with `minimum_should_match_script`
is a way to accomplish this. To make the query request more configurable,
you can define `min_actors_to_see` as a script parameter.

To ensure that the parameter `min_actors_to_see` doesn't exceed
the number of favorite actors, you can use `num_term`s to get
the number of actors in the list and `Math.min` to get the lesser
of the two.

Math.min(params['num_terms'], params['min_actors_to_see'])

The following request finds seats to performances with at least
two of the three specified actors.

GET seats/_search

                        "min_actors_to_see" : 2
                    }
                }
            }

==== Contexts

Contexts control how scripts are executed, what variables are available at runtime and what the return type is.

===== Painless test script context

The `painless_test` context executes scripts as is and do not add any special parameters.
The only variable that is available is `params`, which can be used to access user defined values.
The result of the script is always converted to a string.
If no context is specified then this context is used by default.

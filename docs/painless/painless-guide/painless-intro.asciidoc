=== A Painless Introduction

==== Welcome to Painless

Welcome to the Painless scripting language!

If you have reached this documentation, you are probably looking to come up
with a solution to your use-case outside of what the standard Elasticsearch
APIs may provide. If so, you're in the right place.

Painless is a scripting language designed to extend the Elasticsearch APIs
under many different environments known as
<<painless-contexts, script contexts>> allowing for solutions to more
advanced use-cases. Each script context provides support for a different
environment such as ingest or scoring and determines what data is available and
how to access that data.

==== Design philosophy

Now, before we dive into the basics of writing a Painless script, let's discuss
the design philosophy we have in mind when choosing the syntax and available
features for the language.

* Safety: Our primary goal is to ensure the security of your cluster. To
that end, Painless uses a fine-grained allowlist with a granularity down to the
members of a class. Anything that is not part of the allowlist simply does not
execute. See the {painless}/painless-api-reference.html[Painless API Reference]
for a complete list of available classes, methods, and fields per script
context.
* Performance: Our secondary goal is to ensure the best performance possible.
Painless compiles directly into JVM bytecode to take advantage of all possible
optimizations the JVM provides which are numerous. We also generally avoid
features that require additional slower checks at runtime.
* Syntax: Our final goal is to implement a syntax with a natural familiarity to
anyone with some basic coding experience. Painless uses a subset of Java syntax
with some additional sugar to improve readability and remove boilerplate. Use
of a Java-like syntax has the additional benefit of a natural compilation path
into JVM bytecode that the syntax and semantics of other languages tend to
heavily complicate.

With that said, let's jump into a few examples of queries using a Painless
script.

==== Hello, world!

For our examples in this introduction we use the
<<painless-execute-api, painless execute API>> which by default allows
us to test a script with simple user-defined parameters and receive a result.

===== Hello, world! as a simple REST query

Let's take a look at a simple script and break out the individual pieces.

[source,console]
----
POST /_scripts/painless/_execute <1>
{
  "script": { <2>
    "source": "return 'Hello, world!';" <3>
  }
}
----
[TEST]
<1> The url partially determines what script contexts are available. In this
case we are using the painless execute API directly without any url parameters.
This means we use the `painless_test` context that optionally makes available
a `Map` of user-defined parameters, and then returns a value as an `Object`.
`Map` and `Object` are known as types, and we will discuss this more in a bit.
<2> We use a standard `script` JSON object to define scripts under most APIs
in Elasticsearch. This particular blob requires `source` as shown here to
define the code, optionally `lang` (though, Painless is the default), and
optionally `params` defined by the user.
<3> This is our actual script. We return a `String` value (converted to `Object`)
of `Hello, world!`, and our response will display this value.

===== Hello, world! with parameters

Let's add `lang` and `params` as part of the `script` JSON object.

[source,console]
----
POST /_scripts/painless/_execute
{
  "script": {
    "source": "return params.get('hello_world');", <1>
    "lang": "painless", <2>
    "params": { <3>
        "hello_world": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }
}
----
[TEST]
<1> This is a big departure from the previous example. Here we have a
`Map` of params that are user-defined. We then call the `get` method on
params to access a value using the `String` key of `hello_world`. There
are a lot of moving pieces here that we will discuss more about later on.
<2> We explicitly specify the `Painless` language, but again, it's not
actually necessary here as `Painless` is the default under most script
contexts.
<3> User-defined parameters are a JSON object that is parsed into a `Map`
made available as a `params` variable within a Painless script. In this
case, we have added a `String` value of `Hello, world!` with a `String`
key of `hello_world`. We then access this value within the example script.

===== Hello, world! but concise

Let's make our script a bit more concise using some of the built-in sugar.

[source,console]
----
POST /_scripts/painless/_execute
{
  "script": {
    "source": "params['hello_world']",
    "params": {
        "hello_world": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }
}
----
[TEST]

We have used three pieces of syntactic sugar to replace some verbosity for a
simple script that is only a single line.

. We first removed the `return` keyword. Painless automatically uses the final
statement in a script (when able) to produce a return value in a script context
that requires one.
. We then removed the semicolon at the end of the statement. Painless does not
require semicolons for the final statement of a block. (However, it does require
them in other cases as to remove ambiguity.)
. Finally, we removed the `get` method and replaced it with braces. Painless
uses a shortcut specifically for the `Map` type that allows us to use braces
instead of the lengthier `get` method.

Admittedly, this last example contains a huge amount of information all at once.
Let's break Painless down into more palatable chunks in the next section.

==== The basics of Painless

A Painless script is structured as one or more statements and optionally
has one or more user-defined functions at the beginning. A script must always
have at least one statement.

==== Types Examples

[source,console]
----
POST /_scripts/painless/_execute
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
        int my_int; <1>
        my_int = 1; <2>
        double my_double = 2.0; <2>
        Map my_map; <4>
        my_map = new HashMap(); <5>
        my_map.put("my_int", my_int); <6>
        my_double.put("my_double", my_double);
        return my_map;
    """
  }
}
----
[TEST]
<1> primitive `int` type declaration
<2> primitive `int` type assignment with an `int` constant
<3> primitive `double` type declaration with assignment of a `double` constant
<4> reference `Map` type declaration
<5> reference `Map` type assignment with a new instance of a `HashMap`
<6> reference types are complex types that have method and fields avaiable to modify internal state

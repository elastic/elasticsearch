== API Extension Plugins

API extension plugins add new functionality to Elasticsearch by adding new APIs or features, usually to do with search or mapping.

=== Core API extension plugins

The core API extension plugins are:

<<plugins-delete-by-query,Delete by Query>>::

The delete by query plugin adds support for deleting all of the documents
(from one or more indices) which match the specified query. It is a
replacement for the problematic _delete-by-query_ functionality which has been
removed from Elasticsearch core.

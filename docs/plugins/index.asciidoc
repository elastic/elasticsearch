== Introduction to plugins

Plugins are a way to enhance the core Elasticsearch functionality in a custom
manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers, native
scripts, custom discovery and more.

There are three types of plugins:

Java plugins::

    These plugins contain only JAR files, and must be installed on every node
    in the cluster.  After installation, each node must be restarted before
    the plugin becomes visible.

Site plugins::

These plugins contain static web content like Javascript, HTML, and CSS files,
that can be served directly from Elasticsearch. Site plugins may only need to
be installed on one node, and do not require a restart to become visible. The
content of site plugins is accessible via a URL like:

    http://yournode:9200/_plugin/[plugin name]

--

Mixed plugins::

    Mixed plugins contain both JAR files and web content.

For advice on writing your own plugin, see <<plugin-authors>>.

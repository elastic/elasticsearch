[[ingest-geoip]]
=== Ingest Geoip Processor Plugin

The GeoIP processor adds information about the geographical location of IP addresses, based on data from the Maxmind databases.
This processor adds this information by default under the `geoip` field.

The ingest-geoip plugin ships by default with the GeoLite2 City and GeoLite2 Country geoip2 databases from Maxmind made available
under the CCA-ShareAlike 3.0 license. For more details see, http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/

The GeoIP processor can run with other geoip2 databases from Maxmind. The files must be copied into the geoip config directory,
and the `database_file` option should be used to specify the filename of the custom database. The geoip config directory
is located at `$ES_HOME/config/ingest/geoip` and holds the shipped databases too.

|======

*Depends on what is available in `database_field`:

* If the GeoLite2 City database is used, then the following fields may be added under the `target_field`: `ip`,
`country_iso_code`, `country_name`, `continent_name`, `region_name`, `city_name`, `timezone`, `latitude`, `longitude`
and `location`. The fields actually added depend on what has been found and which fields were configured in `fields`.
* If the GeoLite2 Country database is used, then the following fields may be added under the `target_field`: `ip`,
`country_iso_code`, `country_name` and `continent_name`. The fields actually added depend on what has been found and which fields were configured in `fields`.

Here is an example that uses the default city database and adds the geographical information to the `geoip` field based on the `ip` field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "description" : "...",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "geoip" : {
        "source_field" : "ip"
      }
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

Here is an example that uses the default country database and adds the geographical information to the `geo` field based on the `ip` field`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "description" : "...",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "geoip" : {
        "source_field" : "ip",
        "target_field" : "geo",
        "database_file" : "GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"
      }
    }
  ]
}

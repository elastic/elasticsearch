[[ingest-useragent]]
=== Ingest Useragent Processor Plugin

The Useragent processor extracts details from the user agent string a browser sends with its web requests. 
This processor adds this information by default under the `useragent` field.

The ingest-useragent plugin ships by default with the regexes.yaml made available by uap-java with an Apache 2.0 license. For more details see https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core.

Both the directory and the file have to be created before starting Elasticsearch. If not specified, ingest-useragent will use the regexes.yaml from uap-core it ships with (see below).
| `properties`           | no        | [`name`, `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `build`, `os`, `os_name`, `os_major`, `os_minor`, `device`] | Controls what properties are added to `target_field`.
|======

Here is an example that adds the user agent details to the `useragent` field based on the `agent` field:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "description" : "...",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "useragent" : {
        "field" : "agent"
      }
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

===== Using a custom regex file
To use a custom regex file for parsing the user agents, that file has to be put into the `config/ingest-useragent` directory and
has to have a `.yaml` filename extension. The file has to be present at node startup, any changes to it or any new files added
while the node is running will not have any effect.

In practice, it will make most sense for any custom regex file to be a variant of the default file, either a more recent version
or a customised version.

The default file included in `ingest-useragent` is the `regexes.yaml` from uap-core: https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml

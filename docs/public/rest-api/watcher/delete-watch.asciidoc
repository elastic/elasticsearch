=== Delete Watch API

The DELETE watch API removes a watch (identified by its `id`) from {watcher}.
Once removed, the document representing the watch in the `.watches` index is
gone and it will never be executed again.

Please note that deleting a watch **does not** delete any watch execution records
related to this watch from the watch history.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a watch must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            watch directly from the `.watches` index using Elasticsearch's
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.watches` index.

The following example deletes a watch with the `my-watch` id:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/watcher/watch/my_watch
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:my_active_watch]

Response:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "found": true,
   "_id": "my_watch",
   "_version": 2
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE

==== Timeouts

When deleting a watch while it is executing, the delete action will block and
wait for the watch execution to finish. Depending on the nature of the watch, in
some situations this can take a while. For this reason, the delete watch action
is associated with a timeout that is set to 10 seconds by default. You can
control this timeout by passing in the `master_timeout` parameter.

The following snippet shows how to change the default timeout of the delete
action to 30 seconds:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/watcher/watch/my_watch?master_timeout=30s
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:my_active_watch]

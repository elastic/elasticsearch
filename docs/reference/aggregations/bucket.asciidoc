== Bucket aggregations

Bucket aggregations don't calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do, but instead, they create
buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion (depending on the aggregation type) which determines
whether or not a document in the current context "falls" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document
sets. In addition to the buckets themselves, the `bucket` aggregations also compute and return the number of documents
that "fell into" each bucket.

Bucket aggregations, as opposed to `metrics` aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be
aggregated for the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation.

There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy. Some define a single bucket, some
define fixed number of multiple buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.

NOTE: The <<search-settings-max-buckets,`search.max_buckets`>> cluster setting
limits the number of buckets allowed in a single response.

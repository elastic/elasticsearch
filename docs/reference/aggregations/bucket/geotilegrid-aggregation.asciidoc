=== GeoTile Grid Aggregation

A multi-bucket aggregation that works on `geo_point` fields and groups points into
buckets that represent cells in a grid. The resulting grid can be sparse and only
contains cells that have matching data. Each cell corresponds to a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map[map tile] as used by many online map
sites. Each cell is labeled using a "{zoom}/{x}/{y}" format, where zoom is equal
to the user-specified precision.

* High precision keys have a larger range for x and y, and represent tiles that
cover only a small area.
* Low precision keys have a smaller range for x and y, and represent tiles that
each cover a large area.

See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels[Zoom level documentation]
on how precision (zoom) correlates to size on the ground. Precision for this
aggregation can be between 0 and 29, inclusive.

WARNING: The highest-precision geotile of length 29 produces cells that cover
less than a 10cm by 10cm of land and so high-precision requests can be very
costly in terms of RAM and result sizes. Please see the example below on how
to first filter the aggregation to a smaller geographic area before requesting
high-levels of detail.

The specified field must be of type `geo_point` (which can only be set
explicitly in the mappings) and it can also hold an array of `geo_point`
fields, in which case all points will be taken into account during aggregation.

==== High-precision requests

When requesting detailed buckets (typically for displaying a "zoomed in" map)
a filter like <<query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query,geo_bounding_box>> should be
applied to narrow the subject area otherwise potentially millions of buckets
will be created and returned.

==== Options

[horizontal]
field::         Mandatory. The name of the field indexed with GeoPoints.

precision::     Optional. The integer zoom of the key used to define
                cells/buckets in the results. Defaults to 7.
                Values outside of [0,29] will be rejected.

size::          Optional. The maximum number of geohash buckets to return
                (defaults to 10,000). When results are trimmed, buckets are
                prioritised based on the volumes of documents they contain.

shard_size::    Optional. To allow for more accurate counting of the top cells
                returned in the final result the aggregation defaults to
                returning `max(10,(size x number-of-shards))` buckets from each
                shard. If this heuristic is undesirable, the number considered
                from each shard can be over-ridden using this parameter.

=== Sampler Aggregation

A filtering aggregation used to limit any sub aggregations' processing to a sample of the top-scoring documents.

.Example use cases:
* Tightening the focus of analytics to high-relevance matches rather than the potentially very long tail of low-quality matches
* Reducing the running cost of aggregations that can produce useful results using only samples e.g. `significant_terms`
 

Example:

A query on StackOverflow data for the popular term `javascript` OR the rarer term
`kibana` will match many documents - most of them missing the word Kibana. To focus
the `significant_terms` aggregation on top-scoring documents that are more likely to match 
the most interesting parts of our query we use a sample.

<1> 200 documents were sampled in total. The cost of performing the nested significant_terms aggregation was
therefore limited rather than unbounded.


Without the `sampler` aggregation the request query considers the full "long tail" of low-quality matches and therefore identifies
less significant terms such as `jquery` and `angular` rather than focusing on the more insightful Kibana-related terms.

==== shard_size

The `shard_size` parameter limits how many top-scoring documents are collected in the sample processed on each shard.
The default value is 100.

==== Limitations

[[sampler-breadth-first-nested-agg]]
===== Cannot be nested under `breadth_first` aggregations
Being a quality-based filter the sampler aggregation needs access to the relevance score produced for each document.
It therefore cannot be nested under a `terms` aggregation which has the `collect_mode` switched from the default `depth_first` mode to `breadth_first` as this discards scores.
In this situation an error will be thrown.

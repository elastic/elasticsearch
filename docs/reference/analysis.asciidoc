_Text analysis_ is the process of converting unstructured text, like
the body of an email or a product description, into a structured format that's
optimized for search.

=== When to configure text analysis

{es} performs text analysis when indexing or searching <<text,`text`>> fields.

If your index doesn't contain `text` fields, no further setup is needed; you can
skip the pages in this section.

However, if you use `text` fields or your text searches aren't returning results
as expected, configuring text analysis can often help. You should also look into
analysis configuration if you're using {es} to:

* Build a search engine
* Mine unstructured data
* Fine-tune search for a specific language
* Perform lexicographic or linguistic research

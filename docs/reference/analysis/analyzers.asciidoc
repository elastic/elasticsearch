== Analyzers

Elasticsearch ships with a wide range of built-in analyzers, which can be used
in any index without further configuration:

<<analysis-standard-analyzer,Standard Analyzer>>::

The `standard` analyzer divides text into terms on word boundaries, as defined
by the Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm. It removes most punctuation,
lowercases terms, and supports removing stop words.

<<analysis-simple-analyzer,Simple Analyzer>>::

The `simple` analyzer divides text into terms whenever it encounters a
character which is not a letter.  It lowercases all terms.

<<analysis-whitespace-analyzer,Whitespace Analyzer>>::

The `whitespace` analyzer divides text into terms whenever it encounters any
whitespace character.  It does not lowercase terms.

<<analysis-stop-analyzer,Stop Analyzer>>::

The `stop` analyzer is like the `simple` analyzer, but also supports removal
of stop words.

<<analysis-keyword-analyzer,Keyword Analyzer>>::

The `keyword` analyzer is a ``noop'' analyzer that accepts whatever text it is
given and outputs the exact same text as a single term.

<<analysis-pattern-analyzer,Pattern Analyzer>>::

The `pattern` analyzer uses a regular expression to split the text into terms.
It supports lower-casing and stop words.

<<analysis-lang-analyzer,Language Analyzers>>::

Elasticsearch provides many language-specific analyzers like `english` or
`french`.

<<analysis-fingerprint-analyzer,Fingerprint Analyzer>>::

The `fingerprint` analyzer is a specialist analyzer which creates a
fingerprint which can be used for duplicate detection.

=== Custom analyzers

If you do not find an analyzer suitable for your needs, you can create a
<<analysis-custom-analyzer,`custom`>> analyzer which combines the appropriate
<<analysis-charfilters, character filters>>,
<<analysis-tokenizers,tokenizer>>, and <<analysis-tokenfilters,token filters>>.

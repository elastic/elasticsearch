== Normalizers

Normalizers are similar to analyzers except that they may only emit a single
token. As a consequence, they do not have a tokenizer and only accept a subset
of the available char filters and token filters. Only the filters that work on
a per-character basis are allowed. For instance a lowercasing filter would be
allowed, but not a stemming filter, which needs to look at the keyword as a
whole. The current list of filters that can be used in a normalizer definition
are: `arabic_normalization`, `asciifolding`, `bengali_normalization`,
`cjk_width`, `decimal_digit`, `elision`, `german_normalization`,
`hindi_normalization`, `indic_normalization`, `lowercase`, `pattern_replace`,
`persian_normalization`, `scandinavian_folding`, `serbian_normalization`,
`sorani_normalization`, `trim`, `uppercase`.

Elasticsearch ships with a `lowercase` built-in normalizer. For other forms of
normalization, a custom configuration is required.

=== Custom normalizers

Custom normalizers take a list of
<<analysis-charfilters, character filters>> and a list of
<<analysis-tokenfilters,token filters>>.

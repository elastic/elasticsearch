=== Keyword Repeat Token Filter

The `keyword_repeat` token filter Emits each incoming token twice once
as keyword and once as a non-keyword to allow an un-stemmed version of a
term to be indexed side by site to the stemmed version of the term.
Given the nature of this filter each token that isn't transformed by a
subsequent stemmer will be indexed twice. Therefore, consider adding a
`unique` filter with `only_on_same_position` set to `true` to drop
unnecessary duplicates.

Note: this is available from `0.90.0.Beta2` on.

Here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
index :
    analysis :
        analyzer :
            myAnalyzer :
                type : custom
                tokenizer : standard
                filter : [lowercase, keyword_repeat, porter_stem, unique_stem]    
            unique_stem:
                type: unique
                only_on_same_position : true
--------------------------------------------------

Synonyms in a synonyms set are defined using *synonym rules*.
Each synonym rule contains words that are synonyms.

You can use two formats to define synonym rules: Solr and WordNet.

===== Solr format

This format uses two different definitions:

* Equivalent synonyms: Define groups of words that are equivalent. Words are separated by commas. Example:
+
[source,synonyms]
----
ipod, i-pod, i pod
computer, pc, laptop
----
* Explicit synonyms: Matches a group of words to other words. Words on the left hand side of the rule definition are expanded into all the possibilities described on the right hand side. Example:
+
[source,synonyms]
----
personal computer => pc
sea biscuit, sea biscit => seabiscuit
----

[discrete]
===== WordNet format

https://wordnet.princeton.edu/[WordNet] defines synonyms sets spanning multiple lines. Each line contains the following information:

* Synonyms set numeric identifier
* Ordinal of the synonym in the synonyms set
* Synonym word
* Word type identifier: Noun (n), verb (v), adjective (a) or adverb (b).
* Depth of the word in the synonym net

s(100000002,2,'advance',v,1,0).

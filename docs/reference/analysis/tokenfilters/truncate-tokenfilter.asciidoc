=== Truncate Token Filter

The `truncate` token filter can be used to truncate tokens into a
specific length. This can come in handy with keyword (single token)
based mapped fields that are used for sorting in order to reduce memory
usage.

It accepts a `length` parameter which control the number of characters
to truncate to, defaults to `10`.

The *elasticsearch* REST APIs are exposed using:

* <<modules-http,JSON over HTTP>>,
* <<modules-thrift,thrift>>,
* <<modules-memcached,memcached>>.

The conventions listed in this chapter can be applied throughout the REST
API, unless otherwise specified.

* <<multi-index>>
* <<common-options>>

[[multi-index]]
== Multiple Indices

Most APIs that refer to an `index` paramter support execution across multiple indices,
using simple `test1,test2,test3` notation (or `_all` for all indices). It also
support wildcards, for example: `test*`, and the ability to "add" (`+`)
and "remove" (`-`), for example: `+test*,-test3`.

All multi indices API support the `ignore_indices` option. Setting it to
`missing` will cause indices that do not exists to be ignored from the
execution. By default, when its not set, the request will fail.

NOTE: Single index APIs such as the <<docs>> and the
<<indices-aliases,single-index `alias` APIs>> do not support multiple indices.

[[common-options]]
== Common options

The following options can be applied to all of the REST APIs.

[float]
=== Pretty Results

When appending `?pretty=true` to any request made, the JSON returned
will be pretty formatted (use it for debugging only!). Another option is
to set `format=yaml` which will cause the result to be returned in the
(sometimes) more readable yaml format.


[float]
=== Human readable output

Statistics are returned in a format suitable for humans
(eg `"exists_time": "1h"` or `"size": "1kb"`) and for computers
(eg `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000`` or `"size_in_bytes": 1024`).
The human readable values can be turned off by adding `?human=false`
to the query string. This makes sense when the stats results are
being consumed by a monitoring tool, rather than intended for human
consumption.  The default for the `human` flag is
`false`. added[1.00.Beta,Previously defaulted to `true`]

[float]
=== Parameters

Rest parameters (when using HTTP, map to HTTP URL parameters) follow the
convention of using underscore casing.

[float]
=== Boolean Values

All REST APIs parameters (both request parameters and JSON body) support
providing boolean "false" as the values: `false`, `0`, `no` and `off`.
All other values are considered "true". Note, this is not related to
fields within a document indexed treated as boolean fields.

[float]
=== Number Values

All REST APIs support providing numbered parameters as `string` on top
of supporting the native JSON number types.

[float]
=== Result Casing

All REST APIs accept the `case` parameter. When set to `camelCase`, all
field names in the result will be returned in camel casing, otherwise,
underscore casing will be used. Note, this does not apply to the source
document indexed.

[float]
=== JSONP

All REST APIs accept a `callback` parameter resulting in a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP] result.

[float]
=== Request body in query string

For libraries that don't accept a request body for non-POST requests,
you can pass the request body as the `source` query string parameter
instead.

=== Frozen storage decider

The {cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[autoscaling] frozen storage decider (`frozen_storage`) calculates the local storage
required to search the current set of partially mounted indices based on a
percentage of the total data set size of such indices. It signals that
additional storage capacity is necessary when existing capacity is less than the
percentage multiplied by total data set size.

The frozen storage decider is enabled for all policies governing frozen data
nodes and has no configuration options.

[[cat-thread-pool]]
== cat thread pool

The `thread_pool` command shows cluster wide thread pool statistics per node. By default the active, queue and rejected
statistics are returned for the bulk, index and search thread pools.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
% curl 192.168.56.10:9200/_cat/thread_pool
host1 192.168.1.35 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
host2 192.168.1.36 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
--------------------------------------------------

The first two columns contain the host and ip of a node.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
host      ip
host1 192.168.1.35
host2 192.168.1.36
--------------------------------------------------

The next three columns show the active queue and rejected statistics for the bulk thread pool.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
bulk.active bulk.queue bulk.rejected
          0          0             0
--------------------------------------------------

The remaining columns show the active queue and rejected statistics of the index and search thread pool respectively.

Also other statistics of different thread pools can be retrieved by using the `h` (header) parameter.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
% curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/thread_pool?v&h=id,host,suggest.active,suggest.rejected,suggest.completed'
host      suggest.active suggest.rejected suggest.completed
host1                  0                0                 0
host2                  0                0                 0
--------------------------------------------------

Here the host columns and the active, rejected and completed suggest thread pool statistic are displayed. The suggest
thread pool won't be displayed by default, so you always need to be specific about what statistic you want to display.

|=======================================================================

The thread pool name (or alias) must be combined with a thread pool field below
to retrieve the requested information.

[float]
==== Thread Pool Fields

For each thread pool, you can load details about it by using the field names
in the table below, either using the full field name (e.g. `bulk.active`) or
its alias (e.g. `sa` is equivalent to `search.active`).

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Alias |Description
|`type` |`t` |The current (*) type of thread pool (`cached`, `fixed` or `scaling`)
|`active` |`a` |The number of active threads in the current thread pool
|`size` |`s` |The number of threads in the current thread pool
|`queue` |`q` |The number of tasks in the queue for the current thread pool
|`queueSize` |`qs` |The maximum number of tasks in the queue for the current thread pool
|`rejected` |`r` |The number of rejected threads in the current thread pool
|`largest` |`l` |The highest number of active threads in the current thread pool
|`completed` |`c` |The number of completed threads in the current thread pool
|`min` |`mi` |The configured minimum number of active threads allowed in the current thread pool
|`max` |`ma` |The configured maximum number of active threads allowed in the current thread pool
|`keepAlive` |`k` |The configured keep alive time for threads
|=======================================================================

[float]
=== Other Fields

In addition to details about each thread pool, it is also convenient to get an
understanding of where those thread pools reside.  As such, you can request
other details like the `ip` of the responding node(s).

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Alias |Description
|`id` |`nodeId` |The unique node ID
|`pid` |`p` |The process ID of the running node
|`host` |`h` |The hostname for the current node
|`ip` |`i` |The IP address for the current node
|`port` |`po` |The bound transport port for the current node

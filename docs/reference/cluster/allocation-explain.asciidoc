[[cluster-allocation-explain-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET _cluster/allocation/explain`

`POST _cluster/allocation/explain`

[[cluster-allocation-explain-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `monitor` or
`manage` <<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

[[cluster-allocation-explain-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The purpose of the cluster allocation explain API is to provide
explanations for shard allocations in the cluster. For unassigned shards,
the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is unassigned.
For assigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the
shard is remaining on its current node and has not moved or rebalanced to
another node. This API can be very useful when attempting to diagnose why a
shard is unassigned or why a shard continues to remain on its current node when
you might expect otherwise.

[[cluster-allocation-explain-api-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

`include_disk_info`::
    (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns information about disk usage and
    shard sizes. Defaults to `false`.

`include_yes_decisions`::
    (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns 'YES' decisions in explanation.
    Defaults to `false`.

[[cluster-allocation-explain-api-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`current_node`::
    (Optional, string) Specifies the node ID or the name of the node currently
    holding the shard to explain. To explain an unassigned shard, omit this
    parameter.

`index`::
    (Optional, string) Specifies the name of the index that you would like an
    explanation for.

`primary`::
    (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns explanation for the primary shard
    for the given shard ID.

`shard`::
    (Optional, integer) Specifies the ID of the shard that you would like an
    explanation for.

<1> The current state of the shard.

<3> Whether to allocate the shard.
<4> Whether to allocate the shard to the particular node.
<5> The decider which led to the `no` decision for the node.
<6> An explanation as to why the decider returned a `no` decision, with a helpful hint pointing to the setting that led to the decision. In this example, a newly created index has <<indices-get-settings,an index setting>> that requires that it only be allocated to a node named `nonexistent_node`, which does not exist, so the index is unable to allocate.

// NOTCONSOLE
When Elasticsearch is unable to allocate a shard, it will attempt to retry allocation up to
the maximum number of retries allowed. After this, Elasticsearch will stop attempting to
allocate the shard in order to prevent infinite retries which may impact cluster
performance. Run the <<cluster-reroute,cluster reroute>> API to retry allocation, which
will allocate the shard if the issue preventing allocation has been resolved.

[[no-valid-shard-copy]]
====== No valid shard copy

The following response contains an allocation explanation for an unassigned
primary shard that was previously allocated.

}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

If a shard is unassigned with an allocation status of `no_valid_shard_copy`, then you should <<fix-cluster-status-recover-nodes,make sure that all nodes are in the cluster>>. If all the nodes containing in-sync copies of a shard are lost, then you can <<fix-cluster-status-restore,recover the data for the shard>>.

If you call the API with no arguments, {es} retrieves an allocation explanation
for an arbitrary unassigned primary or replica shard, returning any unassigned primary shards first.

// TEST[catch:bad_request]

If the cluster contains no unassigned shards, the API returns a `400` error.

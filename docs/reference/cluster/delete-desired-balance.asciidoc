=== Reset desired balance API

NOTE: {cloud-only}

Discards the current desired balance and computes a new desired balance starting from the current allocation of shards.
This can sometimes help {es} find a desired balance which needs fewer shard movements to achieve, especially if the
cluster has experienced changes so substantial that the current desired balance is no longer optimal without {es} having
detected that the current desired balance will take more shard movements to achieve than needed. However, this API
imposes a heavy load on the elected master node and may not always have the expected effect. Calling this API should
never be necessary. Consider instead <<shards-rebalancing-heuristics,increasing the value of
`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold`>> to avoid excessive shard movements.

[[cluster-nodes-stats-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

You can use the cluster nodes stats API to retrieve statistics for nodes in a cluster.


All the nodes selective options are explained <<cluster-nodes,here>>.

By default, all stats are returned. You can limit the returned information by 
using metrics.

NOTE: For the cgroup stats to be visible, cgroups must be compiled into the 
kernel, the `cpu` and `cpuacct` cgroup subsystems must be configured and stats 
must be readable from `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu` and `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct`.

===== `adaptive_selection` section

The `adaptive_selection` statistics are keyed by node. For each node:

`adaptive_selection.outgoing_searches`::
    The number of outstanding search requests from the node these stats are for 
    to the keyed node.

`avg_queue_size`::
    The exponentially weighted moving average queue size of search requests on 
    the keyed node.

`avg_service_time_ns`::
    The exponentially weighted moving average service time of search requests on
    the keyed node.

`avg_response_time_ns`::
    The exponentially weighted moving average response time of search requests 
    on the keyed node.

`rank`::
    The rank of this node; used for shard selection when routing search 
    requests.

==== {api-examples-title}

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
# return just indices
GET /_nodes/stats/indices

# return just os and process
GET /_nodes/stats/os,process

# return just process for node with IP address 10.0.0.1
GET /_nodes/10.0.0.1/stats/process
--------------------------------------------------

All stats can be explicitly requested via `/_nodes/stats/_all` or 
`/_nodes/stats?metric=_all`.

You can get information about indices stats on `node`, `indices`, or `shards` 
level.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
# Fielddata summarized by node
GET /_nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?fields=field1,field2

# Fielddata summarized by node and index
GET /_nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?level=indices&fields=field1,field2

# Fielddata summarized by node, index, and shard
GET /_nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?level=shards&fields=field1,field2

# You can use wildcards for field names
GET /_nodes/stats/indices/fielddata?fields=field*
--------------------------------------------------

You can get statistics about search groups for searches executed
on this node.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
# All groups with all stats
GET /_nodes/stats?groups=_all

# Some groups from just the indices stats
GET /_nodes/stats/indices?groups=foo,bar
--------------------------------------------------

[[cluster-nodes-stats-ingest-ex]]
===== Retrieve ingest statistics only

To return only ingest-related node statistics, set the `<metric>` path
parameter to `ingest` and use the
<<common-options-response-filtering,`filter_path`>> query parameter.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats/ingest?filter_path=nodes.*.ingest
--------------------------------------------------

You can use the `metric` and `filter_path` query parameters to get the same
response.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats?metric=ingest&filter_path=nodes.*.ingest
--------------------------------------------------

To further refine the response, change the `filter_path` value.
For example, the following request only returns ingest pipeline statistics.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats?metric=ingest&filter_path=nodes.*.ingest.pipelines
--------------------------------------------------

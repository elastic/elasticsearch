[[cluster-nodes-stats-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

You can use the cluster nodes stats API to retrieve statistics for nodes in a cluster.


All the nodes selective options are explained <<cluster-nodes,here>>.

By default, all stats are returned. You can limit the returned information by 
using metrics.

    store in a `long`, so is returned as a string so that the value returned can 
    exactly match what the underlying operating system interface returns. Any

    limit has been set for the cgroup.

`os.cgroup.memory.usage_in_bytes` (Linux only)::
    The total current memory usage by processes in the cgroup (in bytes) by all 
    tasks in the same cgroup as the {es} process. This value is stored as a 
    string for consistency with `os.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes`.

NOTE: For the cgroup stats to be visible, cgroups must be compiled into the 
kernel, the `cpu` and `cpuacct` cgroup subsystems must be configured and stats 
must be readable from `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu` and `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct`.

    Maximum number of file descriptors allowed on the system, or -1 if not 
    supported.

`process.cpu.percent`::
    CPU usage in percent, or -1 if not known at the time the stats are computed

`process.cpu.total_in_millis`::
    CPU time (in milliseconds) used by the process on which the Java virtual 
    machine is running, or -1 if not supported.

    The total number of documents currently being ingested.

`ingest.total.failed`::
    The total number ingest preprocessing operations failed during the lifetime 
    of this node.

On top of these overall ingest statistics, these statistics are also provided on 
a per pipeline basis.

The `adaptive_selection` flag can be set to retrieve statistics that concern
<<search-adaptive-replica,adaptive replica selection>>. These statistics are
keyed by node. For each node:

`adaptive_selection.outgoing_searches`::

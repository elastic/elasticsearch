[float]
=== Nodes statistics

The cluster nodes stats API allows to retrieve one or more (or all) of
the cluster nodes statistics.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats
GET /_nodes/nodeId1,nodeId2/stats
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The first command retrieves stats of all the nodes in the cluster. The
second command selectively retrieves nodes stats of only `nodeId1` and
`nodeId2`. All the nodes selective options are explained
<<cluster-nodes,here>>.

By default, all stats are returned. You can limit this by combining any
of `indices`, `os`, `process`, `jvm`, `transport`, `http`,
`fs`, `breaker` and `thread_pool`. For example:

[horizontal]
`indices`::
  Indices stats about size, document count, indexing and
  deletion times, search times, field cache size, merges and flushes

`fs`::
  File system information, data path, free disk space, read/write
  stats (see <<fs-info,FS information>>)

`http`::
  HTTP connection information

`jvm`::
  JVM stats, memory pool information, garbage collection, buffer
  pools, number of loaded/unloaded classes

`os`::
  Operating system stats, load average, mem, swap
  (see <<os-stats,OS statistics>>)

`process`::
  Process statistics, memory consumption, cpu usage, open
  file descriptors (see <<process-stats,Process statistics>>)

`thread_pool`::
  Statistics about each thread pool, including current
  size, queue and rejected tasks

`transport`::
  Transport statistics about sent and received bytes in
  cluster communication

`breaker`::
  Statistics about the field data circuit breaker

`discovery`::
  Statistics about the discovery

`ingest`::
    Statistics about ingest preprocessing

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
# return just indices
GET /_nodes/stats/indices

# return just os and process
GET /_nodes/stats/os,process

# return just process for node with IP address 10.0.0.1
GET /_nodes/10.0.0.1/stats/process
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

All stats can be explicitly requested via `/_nodes/stats/_all` or `/_nodes/stats?metric=_all`.

    the same cgroup as the Elasticsearch process should have their
    access to CPU resources reallocated.

`os.cgroup.cpu.cfs_quota_micros` (Linux only)::
    The total amount of time (in microseconds) for which all tasks in
    the same cgroup as the Elasticsearch process can run during one
    period `os.cgroup.cpu.cfs_period_micros`

`os.cgroup.cpu.stat.number_of_elapsed_periods` (Linux only)::
    The number of reporting periods (as specified by
    `os.cgroup.cpu.cfs_period_micros`) that have elapsed

`os.cgroup.cpu.stat.number_of_times_throttled` (Linux only)::

    belongs

`os.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes` (Linux only)::
    The maximum amount of user memory (including file cache) allowed
    for all tasks in the same cgroup as the Elasticsearch process.
    This value can be too big to store in a `long`, so is returned as
    a string so that the value returned can exactly match what the
    underlying operating system interface returns. Any value that is
    too large to parse into a `long` almost certainly means no limit
    has been set for the cgroup.

`os.cgroup.memory.usage_in_bytes` (Linux only)::
    The total current memory usage by processes in the cgroup (in bytes)
    by all tasks in the same cgroup as the Elasticsearch process.
    This value is stored as a string for consistency with
    `os.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes`.

NOTE: For the cgroup stats to be visible, cgroups must be compiled into
the kernal, the `cpu` and `cpuacct` cgroup subsystems must be
configured and stats must be readable from `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu`
and `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpuacct`.

the current running process:

  CPU usage in percent, or -1 if not known at the time the stats are computed

`process.cpu.total_in_millis`::
  CPU time (in milliseconds) used by the process on which the Java virtual machine is running, or -1 if not supported

`process.mem.total_virtual_in_bytes`::
  Size in bytes of virtual memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process

=== Pending cluster tasks

Returns cluster-level changes that have not yet been executed.

[[cluster-pending-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The pending cluster tasks API returns a list of any cluster-level changes (e.g. 
create index, update mapping, allocate or fail shard) which have not yet been 
executed.

NOTE: This API returns a list of any pending updates to the cluster state. These are distinct from the tasks reported by the
<<tasks,Task Management API>> which include periodic tasks and tasks initiated by the user, such as node stats, search queries, or create
index requests. However, if a user-initiated task such as a create index command causes a cluster state update, the activity of this task
might be reported by both task api and pending cluster tasks API.

`tasks`::
    (object) A list of pending tasks.
    
`insert_order`::
    (integer) The number that represents when the task has been inserted into

    and origin. 
    
`time_in_queue_millis`::
    (integer) The time expressed in milliseconds since the task is waiting for 
    being performed.
    
`time_in_queue`::
    (string) The time since the task is waiting for being performed.


[[cluster-pending-api-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

Usually the request will return an empty list as cluster-level changes are fast. 
However, if there are tasks queued up, the response will look similar like this:

   "tasks": [
      {
         "insert_order": 101,

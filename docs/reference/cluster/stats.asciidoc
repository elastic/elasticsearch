[[cluster-stats-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The Cluster Stats API allows to retrieve statistics from a cluster wide
perspective. The API returns basic index metrics (shard numbers, store size,
memory usage) and information about the current nodes that form the cluster
(number, roles, os, jvm versions, memory usage, cpu and installed plugins).

// These replacements do a few things:
// 1. Ignore the contents of the `plugins` object because we don't know all of
//    the plugins that will be in it. And because we figure folks don't need to
//    see an exhaustive list anyway.
// 2. Similarly, ignore the contents of `network_types`, `discovery_types`, and
//    `packaging_types`.
// 3. Ignore the contents of the (nodes) count object, as what's shown here
//    depends on the license. Voting-only nodes are e.g. only shown when this
//    test runs with a basic license.
// 4. All of the numbers and strings on the right hand side of *every* field in
//    the response are ignored. So we're really only asserting things about the
//    the shape of this response, not the values in it.

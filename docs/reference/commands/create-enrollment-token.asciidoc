=== Description

NOTE: `elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` can only be used with {es} clusters
that have been <<configuring-stack-security,auto-configured for security>>.

Use this command to create enrollment tokens, which you can use to enroll new
{es} nodes to an existing cluster or configure {kib} instances to communicate
with an existing {es} cluster that has security features enabled.
The command generates (and subsequently removes) a temporary user in the
<<file-realm,file realm>> to run the request that creates enrollment tokens.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use this tool if the file realm is disabled in your
`elasticsearch.yml` file.

This command uses an HTTP connection to connect to the cluster and run the user
management requests. The command automatically attempts to establish the connection
over HTTPS by using the `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings in
the `elasticsearch.yml` file. If you do not use the default configuration directory,
ensure that the `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable returns the
correct path before you run the `elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` command. You can
override settings in your `elasticsearch.yml` file by using the `-E` command
option. For more information about debugging connection failures, see
<<trb-security-setup>>.

=== Parameters

`-E <KeyValuePair>`:: Configures a standard {es} or {xpack} setting.

`-f, --force`:: Forces the command to run against an unhealthy cluster.

`-h, --help`:: Returns all of the command parameters.

`-s, --scope`:: Specifies the scope of the generated token. Supported values are `node` and `kibana`.

`--url`:: Specifies the base URL (hostname and port of the local node) that the tool uses to submit API
requests to {es}. The default value is determined from the settings in your
`elasticsearch.yml` file. If `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`  is set to `true`,
you must specify an HTTPS URL.

=== Examples

The following command creates an enrollment token for enrolling an {es} node into a cluster:

[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node

The following command creates an enrollment token for enrolling a {kib} instance into a cluster.
The specified URL indicates where the elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token tool attempts to reach the
local {es} node:

[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana --url "https://172.0.0.3:9200"

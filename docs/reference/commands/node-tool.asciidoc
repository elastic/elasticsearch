[[node-tool]]
== elasticsearch-node

The `elasticsearch-node` command enables you to perform certain unsafe
operations on a node that are only possible while it is shut down. This command
allows you to adjust the <<modules-node,role>> of a node, unsafely edit cluster
settings and may be able to recover some data after a disaster or start a node
even if it is incompatible with the data on disk.

=== Description

This tool has a number of modes:

* `elasticsearch-node repurpose` can be used to delete unwanted data from a
  node if it used to be a <<data-node,data node>> or a
  <<master-node,master-eligible node>> but has been repurposed not to have one
  or other of these roles.

* `elasticsearch-node remove-settings` can be used to remove persistent settings
  from the cluster state in case where it contains incompatible settings that
  prevent the cluster from forming.

* `elasticsearch-node remove-customs` can be used to remove custom metadata
  from the cluster state in case where it contains broken metadata that
  prevents the cluster state from being loaded.

* `elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap` can be used to perform _unsafe cluster
  bootstrapping_.  It forces one of the nodes to form a brand-new cluster on
  its own, using its local copy of the cluster metadata.

* `elasticsearch-node detach-cluster` enables you to move nodes from one
  cluster to another.  This can be used to move nodes into a new cluster
  created with the `elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstap` command. If unsafe
  cluster bootstrapping was not possible, it also enables you to move nodes
  into a brand-new cluster.

* `elasticsearch-node override-version` enables you to start up a node
  even if the data in the data path was written by an incompatible version of
  {es}. This may sometimes allow you to downgrade to an earlier version of
  {es}.

==== Changing the role of a node

There may be situations where you want to repurpose a node without following
the <<change-node-role,proper repurposing processes>>. The `elasticsearch-node
repurpose` tool allows you to delete any excess on-disk data and start a node
after repurposing it.

The intended use is:

* Stop the node
* Update `elasticsearch.yml` by setting `node.master` and `node.data` as
  desired.
* Run `elasticsearch-node repurpose` on the node
* Start the node

If you run `elasticsearch-node repurpose` on a node with `node.data: false` and
`node.master: true` then it will delete any remaining shard data on that node,
but it will leave the index and cluster metadata alone. If you run
`elasticsearch-node repurpose` on a node with `node.data: false` and
`node.master: false` then it will delete any remaining shard data and index
metadata, but it will leave the cluster metadata alone.

[WARNING]
Running this command can lead to data loss for the indices mentioned if the
data contained is not available on other nodes in the cluster. Only run this
tool if you understand and accept the possible consequences, and only after
determining that the node cannot be repurposed cleanly.

The tool provides a summary of the data to be deleted and asks for confirmation
before making any changes. You can get detailed information about the affected
indices and shards by passing the verbose (`-v`) option.

[float]
==== Removing persistent cluster settings

There may be situations where a node contains persistent cluster
settings that prevent the cluster from forming. Since the cluster cannot form,
it is not possible to remove these settings using the
<<cluster-update-settings>> API.

The `elasticsearch-node remove-settings` tool allows you to forcefully remove
those persistent settings from the on-disk cluster state. The tool takes a
list of settings as parameters that should be removed, and also supports
wildcard patterns.

The intended use is:

* Stop the node
* Run `elasticsearch-node remove-settings name-of-setting-to-remove` on the node
* Repeat for all other master-eligible nodes
* Start the nodes

[float]
==== Removing custom metadata from the cluster state

There may be situations where a node contains custom metadata, typically
provided by plugins, that prevent the node from starting up and loading
the cluster from disk.

The `elasticsearch-node remove-customs` tool allows you to forcefully remove
the problematic custom metadata. The tool takes a list of custom metadata names
as parameters that should be removed, and also supports wildcard patterns.

The intended use is:

* Stop the node
* Run `elasticsearch-node remove-customs name-of-custom-to-remove` on the node
* Repeat for all other master-eligible nodes
* Start the nodes

[float]
==== Recovering data after a disaster

Sometimes {es} nodes are temporarily stopped, perhaps because of the need to
perform some maintenance activity or perhaps because of a hardware failure.
After you resolve the temporary condition and restart the node,
it will rejoin the cluster and continue normally. Depending on your
configuration, your cluster may be able to remain completely available even
while one or more of its nodes are stopped.

Sometimes it might not be possible to restart a node after it has stopped. For
example, the node's host may suffer from a hardware problem that cannot be
repaired. If the cluster is still available then you can start up a fresh node
on another host and {es} will bring this node into the cluster in place of the
failed node.

Each node stores its data in the data directories defined by the
<<path-settings,`path.data` setting>>. This means that in a disaster you can
also restart a node by moving its data directories to another host, presuming
that those data directories can be recovered from the faulty host.

{es} <<modules-discovery-quorums,requires a response from a majority of the
master-eligible nodes>> in order to elect a master and to update the cluster
state. This means that if you have three master-eligible nodes then the cluster
will remain available even if one of them has failed. However if two of the
three master-eligible nodes fail then the cluster will be unavailable until at
least one of them is restarted.

In very rare circumstances it may not be possible to restart enough nodes to
restore the cluster's availability. If such a disaster occurs, you should
build a new cluster from a recent snapshot and re-import any data that was
ingested since that snapshot was taken.

However, if the disaster is serious enough then it may not be possible to
recover from a recent snapshot either. Unfortunately in this case there is no
way forward that does not risk data loss, but it may be possible to use the
`elasticsearch-node` tool to construct a new cluster that contains some of the
data from the failed cluster.

[[node-tool-override-version]]
[float]
==== Bypassing version checks

The data that {es} writes to disk is designed to be read by the current version
and a limited set of future versions. It cannot generally be read by older
versions, nor by versions that are more than one major version newer. The data
stored on disk includes the version of the node that wrote it, and {es} checks
that it is compatible with this version when starting up.

In rare circumstances it may be desirable to bypass this check and start up an
{es} node using data that was written by an incompatible version. This may not
work if the format of the stored data has changed, and it is a risky process
because it is possible for the format to change in ways that {es} may
misinterpret, silently leading to data loss.

To bypass this check, you can use the `elasticsearch-node override-version`
tool to overwrite the version number stored in the data path with the current
version, causing {es} to believe that it is compatible with the on-disk data.

[[node-tool-unsafe-bootstrap]]
[float]
===== Unsafe cluster bootstrapping

If there is at least one remaining master-eligible node, but it is not possible
to restart a majority of them, then the `elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap`
command will unsafely override the cluster's <<modules-discovery-voting,voting
configuration>> as if performing another
<<modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster,cluster bootstrapping process>>.
The target node can then form a new cluster on its own by using
the cluster metadata held locally on the target node.

[WARNING]
These steps can lead to arbitrary data loss since the target node may not hold the latest cluster
metadata, and this out-of-date metadata may make it impossible to use some or
all of the indices in the cluster.

Since unsafe bootstrapping forms a new cluster containing a single node, once
you have run it you must use the <<node-tool-detach-cluster,`elasticsearch-node
detach-cluster` tool>> to migrate any other surviving nodes from the failed
cluster into this new cluster.

When you run the `elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap` tool it will analyse the
state of the node and ask for confirmation before taking any action. Before
asking for confirmation it reports the term and version of the cluster state on
the node on which it runs as follows:

[source,txt]
----
Current node cluster state (term, version) pair is (4, 12)
----

If you have a choice of nodes on which to run this tool then you should choose
one with a term that is as large as possible. If there is more than one
node with the same term, pick the one with the largest version.
This information identifies the node with the freshest cluster state, which minimizes the
quantity of data that might be lost. For example, if the first node reports
`(4, 12)` and a second node reports `(5, 3)`, then the second node is preferred
since its term is larger.  However if the second node reports `(3, 17)` then
the first node is preferred since its term is larger. If the second node
reports `(4, 10)` then it has the same term as the first node, but has a
smaller version, so the first node is preferred.

[WARNING]
Running this command can lead to arbitrary data loss. Only run this tool if you
understand and accept the possible consequences and have exhausted all other
possibilities for recovery of your cluster.

The sequence of operations for using this tool are as follows:

1. Make sure you have really lost access to at least half of the
master-eligible nodes in the cluster, and they cannot be repaired or recovered
by moving their data paths to healthy hardware.
2. Stop **all** remaining nodes.
3. Choose one of the remaining master-eligible nodes to become the new elected
master as described above.
4. On this node, run the `elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap` command as shown
below. Verify that the tool reported `Master node was successfully
bootstrapped`.
5. Start this node and verify that it is elected as the master node.
6. Run the <<node-tool-detach-cluster,`elasticsearch-node detach-cluster`
tool>>, described below, on every other node in the cluster.
7. Start all other nodes and verify that each one joins the cluster.
8. Investigate the data in the cluster to discover if any was lost during this
process.

When you run the tool it will make sure that the node that is being used to
bootstrap the cluster is not running. It is important that all other
master-eligible nodes are also stopped while this tool is running, but the tool
does not check this.

The message `Master node was successfully bootstrapped` does not mean that
there has been no data loss, it just means that tool was able to complete its
job.

[[node-tool-detach-cluster]]
[float]
===== Detaching nodes from their cluster

It is unsafe for nodes to move between clusters, because different clusters
have completely different cluster metadata. There is no way to safely merge the
metadata from two clusters together.

To protect against inadvertently joining the wrong cluster, each cluster
creates a unique identifier, known as the _cluster UUID_, when it first starts
up. Every node records the UUID of its cluster and refuses to join a
cluster with a different UUID.

However, if a node's cluster has permanently failed then it may be desirable to
try and move it into a new cluster. The `elasticsearch-node detach-cluster`
command lets you detach a node from its cluster by resetting its cluster UUID.
It can then join another cluster with a different UUID.

For example, after unsafe cluster bootstrapping you will need to detach all the
other surviving nodes from their old cluster so they can join the new,
unsafely-bootstrapped cluster.

Unsafe cluster bootstrapping is only possible if there is at least one
surviving master-eligible node. If there are no remaining master-eligible nodes
then the cluster metadata is completely lost. However, the individual data
nodes also contain a copy of the index metadata corresponding with their
shards. This sometimes allows a new cluster to import these shards as
<<modules-gateway-dangling-indices,dangling indices>>. You can sometimes
recover some indices after the loss of all master-eligible nodes in a cluster
by creating a new cluster and then using the `elasticsearch-node
detach-cluster` command to move any surviving nodes into this new cluster.

There is a risk of data loss when importing a dangling index because data nodes
may not have the most recent copy of the index metadata and do not have any
information about <<docs-replication,which shard copies are in-sync>>. This
means that a stale shard copy may be selected to be the primary, and some of
the shards may be incompatible with the imported mapping.

[WARNING]
Execution of this command can lead to arbitrary data loss. Only run this tool
if you understand and accept the possible consequences and have exhausted all
other possibilities for recovery of your cluster.

The sequence of operations for using this tool are as follows:

1. Make sure you have really lost access to every one of the master-eligible
nodes in the cluster, and they cannot be repaired or recovered by moving their
data paths to healthy hardware.
2. Start a new cluster and verify that it is healthy. This cluster may comprise
one or more brand-new master-eligible nodes, or may be an unsafely-bootstrapped
cluster formed as described above.
3. Stop **all** remaining data nodes.
4. On each data node, run the `elasticsearch-node detach-cluster` tool as shown
below. Verify that the tool reported `Node was successfully detached from the
cluster`.
5. If necessary, configure each data node to
<<modules-discovery-hosts-providers,discover the new cluster>>.
6. Start each data node and verify that it has joined the new cluster.
7. Wait for all recoveries to have completed, and investigate the data in the
cluster to discover if any was lost during this process.

The message `Node was successfully detached from the cluster` does not mean
that there has been no data loss, it just means that tool was able to complete
its job.

==== Bypassing version checks

Run the `elasticsearch-node override-version` command to overwrite the version
stored in the data path so that a node can start despite being incompatible
with the data stored in the data path:

----
node$ ./bin/elasticsearch-node override-version

    WARNING: Elasticsearch MUST be stopped before running this tool.

This data path was last written by Elasticsearch version [x.x.x] and may no
longer be compatible with Elasticsearch version [y.y.y]. This tool will bypass
this compatibility check, allowing a version [y.y.y] node to start on this data
path, but a version [y.y.y] node may not be able to read this data or may read
it incorrectly leading to data loss.

You should not use this tool. Instead, continue to use a version [x.x.x] node
on this data path. If necessary, you can use reindex-from-remote to copy the
data from here into an older cluster.

Do you want to proceed?

Confirm [y/N] y

Claims a connector sync job.

The `_claim` endpoint is not intended for direct connector management by users. It is there to support the implementation of services that utilize the https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/docs/CONNECTOR_PROTOCOL.md[Connector Protocol] to communicate with {es}.

To get started with Connector APIs, check out the {enterprise-search-ref}/connectors-tutorial-api.html[tutorial^].

[[claim-connector-sync-job-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}
`PUT _connector/_sync_job/<connector_sync_job_id>/_claim`

[[claim-connector-sync-job-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the {enterprise-search-ref}/build-connector.html[Elastic connector service] on your own infrastructure. This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for native connectors.
* The `connector_sync_job_id` parameter should reference an existing connector sync job.

[[claim-connector-sync-job-api-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example claims the connector sync job with ID `my-connector-sync-job-id`:

[source,console]
----
PUT _connector/_sync_job/my-connector-sync-job-id/_claim
{
  "worker_hostname": "some-machine"
}
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after creating a connector sync job, as we don't know the id ahead of time. Therefore, skip this test.]

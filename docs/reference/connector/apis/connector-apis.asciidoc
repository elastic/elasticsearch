The connector and sync jobs API provides a convenient way to create and manage Elastic connectors and sync jobs in an internal index.

This API provides an alternative to relying solely on {kib} UI for connector and sync job management. The API comes with a set of
validations and assertions to ensure that the state representation in the internal index remains valid.

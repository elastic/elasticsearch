beta::[]

Creates an Elastic connector.
Connectors are {es} integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on {ecloud} or hosted on your own infrastructure:

* *Managed connectors* are a managed service on {ecloud}
* *Self-managed connectors* are self-hosted on your infrastructure

Find a list of all supported service types in the <<es-connectors,connectors documentation>>.

To get started with Connector APIs, check out <<es-connectors-tutorial-api, our tutorial>>.

==== {api-request-title}
* `POST _connector`

* `PUT _connector/<connector_id>`


[[create-connector-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the <<es-connectors-deploy-connector-service,Elastic connector service>>. on your own infrastructure. This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.
* The `service_type` parameter should reference a supported third-party service. See the available service types for <<es-native-connectors,Elastic managed>> and <<es-build-connector,self-managed>> connectors. This can also reference the service type of your custom connector.

[[list-connector-sync-jobs-api-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example lists all connector sync jobs:


[source,console]
----
GET _connector/_sync_job
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after this code snippet, as we don't know the ids of sync jobs ahead of time]

The following example lists the first two connector sync jobs:

[source,console]
----
GET _connector/_sync_job?from=0&size=2
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after this code snippet, as we don't know the ids of sync jobs ahead of time]

The following example lists pending connector sync jobs (the first 100 per default):
[source,console]
----
GET _connector/_sync_job?status=pending
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after this code snippet, as we don't know the ids of sync jobs ahead of time]

The following example lists connector sync jobs (the first 100 per default) for the connector with id `connector-1`:
[source,console]
----
GET _connector/_sync_job?connector_id=connector-1
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after this code snippet, as we don't know the ids of sync jobs ahead of time]

The following example lists connector sync jobs (the first 100 per default) for the connector with job type `full` or `incremental`:
[source,console]
----
GET _connector/_sync_job?job_type=full,incremental
----
// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after this code snippet, as we don't know the ids of sync jobs ahead of time]

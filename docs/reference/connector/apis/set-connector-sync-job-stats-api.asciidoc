==== {api-request-title}
`PUT _connector/_sync_job/<connector_sync_job_id>/_stats`

[[set-connector-sync-job-stats-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the <<es-connectors-deploy-connector-service,Elastic connector service>>. on your own infrastructure. This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.
* The `connector_sync_job_id` parameter should reference an existing connector sync job.

[[set-connector-sync-job-stats-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Sets the stats for a connector sync job.
Stats include: `deleted_document_count`, `indexed_document_count`, `indexed_document_volume` and `total_document_count`.
`last_seen` can also be updated using this API.
This API is mainly used by the connector service for updating sync job information.

The following example sets all mandatory and optional stats for the connector sync job `my-connector-sync-job`:

[source,console]
----
PUT _connector/_sync_job/my-connector-sync-job/_stats
{
    "deleted_document_count": 10,
    "indexed_document_count": 20,
    "indexed_document_volume": 1000,
    "total_document_count": 2000,
    "last_seen": "2023-01-02T10:00:00Z"
}

// TEST[skip:there's no way to clean up after creating a connector sync job, as we don't know the id ahead of time. Therefore, skip this test.]

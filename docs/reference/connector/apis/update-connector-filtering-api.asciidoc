beta::[]

Updates the draft `filtering` configuration of a connector and marks the draft validation state as `edited`. The filtering draft is activated once validated by the running Elastic connector service.

The filtering property is used to configure sync rules (both basic and advanced) for a connector. Learn more in the <<es-sync-rules>>.

To get started with Connector APIs, check out <<es-connectors-tutorial-api, our tutorial>>.

* To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the <<es-connectors-deploy-connector-service,Elastic connector service>>. on your own infrastructure. This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.
* The `connector_id` parameter should reference an existing connector.
* Filtering draft is activated once validated by the running Elastic connector service, the `draft.validation.state` must be `valid`.
* If, after a validation attempt, the `draft.validation.state` equals to `invalid`, inspect `draft.validation.errors` and fix any issues.

`rules`::
(Optional, array of objects)
An array of <<es-sync-rules-basic, basic sync rules>>, each with the following sub-attributes:
* `id` (Required, string) +
A unique identifier for the rule.
* `policy` (Required, string) +
Specifies the policy, such as `include` or `exclude`.
* `field` (Required, string) +
The field in the document to which this rule applies.
* `rule` (Required, string) +
The type of rule, such as `regex`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `contains`, `equals`, `<`, `>`, etc.
* `value` (Required, string) +
The value to be used in conjunction with the rule for matching the contents of the document's field.
* `order` (Required, number) +
The order in which the rules are applied. The first rule to match has its policy applied.
* `created_at` (Optional, datetime) +
The timestamp when the rule was added. Defaults to `now` UTC timestamp.
* `updated_at` (Optional, datetime) +
The timestamp when the rule was last edited. Defaults to `now` UTC timestamp.

`advanced_snippet`::
(Optional, object)
Used for <<es-sync-rules-advanced, advanced filtering>> at query time, with the following sub-attributes:
* `value` (Required, object or array) +
A JSON object/array passed directly to the connector for advanced filtering.
* `created_at` (Optional, datetime) +
The timestamp when this JSON object was created. Defaults to `now` UTC timestamp.
* `updated_at` (Optional, datetime) +
The timestamp when this JSON object was last edited. Defaults to `now` UTC timestamp.

The following example updates the draft <<es-sync-rules-basic, basic sync rules>> for a Google Drive connector with ID `my-g-drive-connector`. All Google Drive files with `.txt` extension will be skipped:

The following example updates the draft advanced sync rules for a MySQL connector with id `my-sql-connector`. Advanced sync rules are specific to each connector type. Refer to the references for connectors that support <<es-sync-rules-advanced, advanced sync rules>> for syntax and examples.

            "query": "SELECT users.id AS id, orders.order_id AS order_id FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id"

Note, you can also update draft `rules` and `advanced_snippet` in a single request.

Once the draft is updated, its validation state is set to `edited`. The connector service will then validate the rules and report the validation state as either `invalid` or `valid`. If the state is `valid`, the draft filtering will be activated by the running Elastic connector service.

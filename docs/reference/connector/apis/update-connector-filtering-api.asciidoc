`filtering`::
(Required, array) The filtering configuration for the connector. This configuration determines the set of rules applied for filtering data during syncs.

Each entry in the `filtering` array represents a set of filtering rules for a specific data domain and includes the following attributes:

- `domain` (Required, string) +
Specifies the data domain to which these filtering rules apply.

- `active` (Required, object) +
Contains the set of rules that are actively used for sync jobs. The `active` object includes:

  * `rules` (Required, array of objects) +
  An array of individual filtering rule objects, each with the following sub-attributes:
    ** `id` (Required, string) +
    A unique identifier for the rule.
    ** `policy` (Required, string) +
    Specifies the policy, such as "include" or "exclude".
    ** `field` (Required, string) +
    The field in the document to which this rule applies.
    ** `rule` (Required, string) +
    The type of rule, such as "regex", "starts_with", "ends_with", "contains", "equals", "<", ">", etc.
    ** `value` (Required, string) +
    The value to be used in conjunction with the rule for matching the contents of the document's field.
    ** `order` (Required, number) +
    The order in which the rules are applied. The first rule to match has its policy applied.
    ** `created_at` (Optional, datetime) +
    The timestamp when the rule was added.
    ** `updated_at` (Optional, datetime) +
    The timestamp when the rule was last edited.

  * `advanced_snippet` (Optional, object) +
  Used for {enterprise-search-ref}/sync-rules.html#sync-rules-advanced[advanced filtering] at query time, with the following sub-attributes:
    ** `value` (Required, object) +
    A JSON object passed directly to the connector for advanced filtering.
    ** `created_at` (Optional, datetime) +
    The timestamp when this JSON object was created.
    ** `updated_at` (Optional, datetime) +
    The timestamp when this JSON object was last edited.

  * `validation` (Optional, object) +
  Provides validation status for the rules, including:
    ** `state` (Required, string) +
    Indicates the validation state: "edited", "valid", or "invalid".
    ** `errors` (Optional, object) +
    Contains details about any validation errors, with sub-attributes:
      *** `ids` (Required, string) +
      The ID(s) of any rules deemed invalid.
      *** `messages` (Required, string) +
      Messages explaining what is invalid about the rules.

- `draft` (Optional, object) +
An object identical in structure to the `active` object, but used for drafting and editing filtering rules before they become active.

==== Use the API

You can use the {es} {ref}/connector-apis.html[Create connector API] to create a new self-managed {service-name} self-managed connector.

For example:

[source, console,subs="+attributes"]
----
PUT _connector/my-{service-name-stub}-connector
{
  "index_name": "my-elasticsearch-index",
  "name": "Content synced from {service-name}",
  "service_type": "{service-name-stub}"
}
----
// TEST[skip:can't test in isolation]


.You'll also need to *create an API key* for the connector to use.

===================================

[NOTE]
====
The user needs the cluster privileges `manage_api_key`, `manage_connector` and `write_connector_secrets` to generate API keys programmatically.
====

To create an API key for the connector:

. Run the following command, replacing values where indicated.
Note the `encoded` return values from the response:

[source, console,subs="+attributes"]
----
POST /_security/api_key
{
  "name": "connector_name-connector-api-key",
  "role_descriptors": {
    "connector_name-connector-role": {
      "cluster": [
        "monitor",
        "manage_connector"
      ],
      "indices": [
        {
          "names": [
            "index_name",
            ".search-acl-filter-index_name",
            ".elastic-connectors*"
          ],
          "privileges": [
            "all"
          ],
          "allow_restricted_indices": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

. Update your `config.yml` file with the API key `encoded` value.

==== Use the API

You can use the {es} {ref}/connector-apis.html[Create connector API] to create a new native {service-name} connector.

For example:

[source, console,subs="+attributes"]
----
PUT _connector/my-{service-name-stub}-connector
{
  "index_name": "my-elasticsearch-index",
  "name": "Content synced from {service-name}",
  "service_type": "{service-name-stub}",
  "is_native": "true"
}
----
// TEST[skip:can't test in isolation]

.You'll also need to *create an API key* for the connector to use.

You can deploy the {service-name} connector as a self-managed connector using Docker.
Follow these instructions.

.*Step 1: Download sample configuration file*
[%collapsible]
====
Download the sample configuration file.
You can either download it manually or run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/connectors/main/config.yml.example --output ~/connectors-config/config.yml
----
// NOTCONSOLE

Remember to update the `--output` argument value if your directory name is different, or you want to use a different config file name.
====

.*Step 2: Update the configuration file for your self-managed connector*
[%collapsible]
====
Update the configuration file with the following settings to match your environment:

* `elasticsearch.host`
* `elasticsearch.api_key`
* `connectors`

If you're running the connector service against a Dockerized version of Elasticsearch and Kibana, your config file will look like this:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
# When connecting to your cloud deployment you should edit the host value
elasticsearch.host: http://host.docker.internal:9200
elasticsearch.api_key: <ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY>

connectors:
  -
    connector_id: <CONNECTOR_ID_FROM_KIBANA>
    service_type: {service-name-stub}
    api_key: <CONNECTOR_API_KEY_FROM_KIBANA> # Optional. If not provided, the connector will use the elasticsearch.api_key instead

----

Using the `elasticsearch.api_key` is the recommended authentication method. However, you can also use `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` to authenticate with your Elasticsearch instance.

Note: You can change other default configurations by simply uncommenting specific settings in the configuration file and modifying their values.

====

.*Step 3: Run the Docker image*
[%collapsible]
====
Run the Docker image with the Connector Service using the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run \
-v ~/connectors-config:/config \
--network "elastic" \
--tty \
--rm \
docker.elastic.co/integrations/elastic-connectors:{version}.0 \
/app/bin/elastic-ingest \
-c /config/config.yml
----
====

Refer to {connectors-python}/docs/DOCKER.md[`DOCKER.md`^] in the `elastic/connectors` repo for more details.

Find all available Docker images in the https://www.docker.elastic.co/r/integrations/elastic-connectors[official registry].

[TIP]
====
We also have a quickstart self-managed option using Docker Compose, so you can spin up all required services at once: Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the connectors service.
Refer to this https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main/scripts/stack#readme[README] in the `elastic/connectors` repo for more information.

==== Box Free Account

[discrete#connectors-box-create-oauth-custom-app]
===== Create Box User Authentication (OAuth 2.0) Custom App

You'll need to create an OAuth app in the Box developer console by following these steps:

1. Register a new app in the https://app.box.com/developers/console[Box dev console] with custom App and select User authentication (OAuth 2.0).
2. Add the URL of the web page in *Redirect URIs*, which is accessible by you.
3. Check "Write all files and folders stored in Box" in Application Scopes.
4. Once the app is created, *Client ID* and *Client secret* values are available in the configuration tab. Keep these handy.

[discrete#connectors-box-connector-generate-a-refresh-token]
===== Generate a refresh Token

To generate a refresh token, follow these steps:

1. Go to the following URL, replacing `<CLIENT_ID>` with the *Client ID* value saved earlier.
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
https://account.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
----
+
2. Grant access to your application.
3. You will now be redirected to the web page that you configured in *Redirect URIs*, and the HTTP response should contain an *authorization code* that you'll use to generate a refresh token.
*Note:* Authorization codes to generate refresh tokens can only be used once and are only valid for 30 seconds.
4. In your terminal, run the following `curl` command, replacing `<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>`, `<CLIENT_ID> and <CLIENT_SECRET>` with the values you saved earlier:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -i -X POST "https://api.box.com/oauth2/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>" \
     -d "client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>" \
     -d "code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
----
+
Save the refresh token from the response. You'll need this for the connector configuration.

[%collapsible]
===============

[discrete#connectors-confluence-availability-prerequisites]
=== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a *native connector* on Elastic Cloud, as of *8.9.1*.

[NOTE]
====
Confluence Data Center support was added in 8.13.0 in technical preview and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Technical preview features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
====

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<native-connectors-prerequisites,native connector requirements>>.

[discrete#connectors-confluence-create-native-connector]
=== Create a {service-name} connector
include::_connectors-create-native.asciidoc[]

[discrete#connectors-confluence-usage]
=== Usage

To use this connector as a *native connector*, see <<connectors-native>>.

For additional operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#connectors-confluence-compatability]
=== Compatibility

* Confluence Cloud or Confluence Server/Data Center *versions 7 or later*.

[discrete#connectors-confluence-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

Confluence data source::
Dropdown to determine the Confluence platform type: `Confluence Cloud`, `Confluence Server`, or `Confluence Data Center`. Default value is `Confluence Server`.

Confluence Data Center username::
The username of the account for Confluence Data Center.

Confluence Data Center password::
The password of the account to be used for the Confluence Data Center.

Confluence Server username::
The username of the account for Confluence server.

Confluence Server password::
The password of the account to be used for Confluence Server.

Confluence Cloud account email::
The account email for Confluence Cloud.

Confluence Cloud API token::
The API Token to authenticate with Confluence cloud.

Confluence URL label::
The domain where the Confluence is hosted. Examples:

* `https://192.158.1.38:8080/`
* `https://test_user.atlassian.net/`

Confluence space keys::
Comma-separated list of https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/space-keys-829076188.html[Space Keys] to fetch data from Confluence server or cloud. If the value is `*`, the connector will fetch data from all spaces present in the configured `spaces`. Default value is `*`. Examples:
+
* `EC`, `TP`
* `*`

Enable indexing labels::
Toggle to enable syncing of labels from pages.
NOTE: This will increase the amount of network calls to the source, and may decrease performance.

Enable SSL::
Whether SSL verification will be enabled. Default value is `False`.

SSL certificate::
Content of SSL certificate. Note: If `ssl_enabled` is `False`, the value in this field is ignored. Example certificate:
+
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID+jCCAuKgAwIBAgIGAJJMzlxLMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMHoxCzAJBgNVBAYT
...
7RhLQyWn2u00L7/9Omw=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<dls, document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
Access control syncs will fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.
[NOTE]
====
To access user data in Jira Administration, the account you created must be granted *Product Access* for Jira Administration.
This access needs to be provided by an administrator from the http://admin.atlassian.com/[Atlassian Admin], and the access level granted should be `Product Admin`.
====

[discrete#connectors-confluence-documents-syncs]
=== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following Confluence object types:

* Pages
* Spaces
* Blog Posts
* Attachments

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced by default.
You must first enable <<connectors-confluence-client-document-level-security,DLS>>.
Otherwise, *all documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#connectors-confluence-sync-types]
==== Sync types

<<connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#connectors-confluence-sync-rules]
=== Sync rules

<<sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

This connector supports <<sync-rules-advanced,advanced sync rules>> for remote filtering.
These rules cover complex query-and-filter scenarios that cannot be expressed with <basic sync rules.
Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.

[discrete#connectors-confluence-sync-rules-examples]
==== Advanced sync rules examples

*Example 1*: Query for indexing data that is in a particular *Space* with key 'DEV'.

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "query": "space = DEV"
  }
]
----

*Example 2*: Queries for indexing data based on `created` and `lastmodified` time.

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "query": "created >= now('-5w')"
  },
  {
    "query": "lastmodified < startOfYear()"
  }
]
----

*Example 3*: Query for indexing only given types in a *Space* with key 'SD'.

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "query": "type in ('page', 'attachment') AND space.key = 'SD'"
  }
]
----

[NOTE]
====
Syncing recently created/updated items in Confluence may be delayed when using advanced sync rules, because the search endpoint used for CQL queries returns stale results in the response.
For more details refer to the following issue in the https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-73997[Confluence documentation^].
====

[discrete#connectors-confluence-document-level-security]
=== Document level security

[NOTE]
====
DLS is automatically available for Atlassian Confluence Cloud since 8.9.0.
DLS is available since 8.14.0 for Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center, but requires installing https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217507/extender-for-confluence?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter[Extender for Confluence].
====

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a user’s permissions.
Refer to <<connectors-confluence-configuration,configuration>> on this page for how to enable DLS for this connector.


[WARNING]
====
When the `data_source` is set to Confluence Data Center or Server, the connector will only fetch 1000 users for access control syncs, due a https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-search/retrieve-users-with-get-users-endpoint#limitations[limitation in the API used^].
====

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<dls-e2e-guide, DLS in Search Applications>> to learn how to ingest data from a connector with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
The example uses SharePoint Online as the data source, but the same steps apply to every connector.

This connector client is compatible with Elastic versions *8.7.0+*.

[NOTE]
====
Confluence Data Center support was added in 8.13.0 in technical preview and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Technical preview features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

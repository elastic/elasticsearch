[discrete#connectors-dropbox-availability-and-prerequisites]
=== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a *native connector* in Elastic versions *8.10.0 and later*.

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<native-connectors-prerequisites,native connector requirements>>.

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-create-native-connector]
=== Create a {service-name} connector
include::_connectors-create-native.asciidoc[]

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-usage]
=== Usage

To use this connector as a *native connector*, see <<native-connectors>>.

For additional operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

Before you can configure your connector, you'll need to:

* <<connectors-dropbox-create-dropbox-oauth-app,Create a Dropbox OAuth app>>
* <<connectors-dropbox-refresh-token,Generate a refresh token>>

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-dropbox-api-authorization]
=== Dropbox API Authorization

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-create-dropbox-oauth-app]
==== Create Dropbox OAuth App

You'll need to create an OAuth app in the Dropbox platform by following these steps:

1. Register a new app in the https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps[Dropbox App Console^].
Select *Full Dropbox API app* and choose the following required permissions:
* `files.content.read`
* `sharing.read`
+
To use document level security, you'll also need the following permissions:
* `team_info.read`
* `team_data.member`
* `team_data.content.read`
* `members.read`
2. Once the app is created, make note of the *app key* and *app secret* values which you'll need to configure the Dropbox connector on your Elastic deployment.

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-refresh-token]
==== Generate a refresh Token

To generate a refresh token, follow these steps:

1. Go to the following URL, replacing `<APP_KEY>` with the *app key* value saved earlier:
`https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<APP_KEY>&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline`
+
The HTTP response should contain an *authorization code* that you'll use to generate a refresh token.
An authorization code *can only be used once* to create a refresh token.
+
2. In your terminal, run the following `cURL` command, replacing `<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>`, `<APP_KEY>:<APP_SECRET>` with the values you saved earlier:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST "https://api.dropboxapi.com/oauth2/token?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>&grant_type=authorization_code" -u "<APP_KEY>:<APP_SECRET>"
----
Store the refresh token from the response to be used in the connector configuration.
+
Make sure the response has a list of the following scopes:
+
* `account_info.read`
* `files.content.read`
* `files.metadata.read`
* `sharing.read`
* `team_info.read` (if using document level security)
* `team_data.member` (if using document level security)
* `team_data.content.read` (if using document level security)
* `members.read` (if using document level security)

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

Path to fetch files/folders::
The folder path to fetch files/folders from Dropbox. Default value is `/`.
+
[Note]
====
This field can be bypassed by advanced sync rules.
====

App key::
The App Key to authenticate your Dropbox application.

App secret::
The App Secret to authenticate your Dropbox application.

Refresh token::
The refresh token to authenticate your Dropbox application.

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<dls, document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
Access control syncs will fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.

Include groups and inherited users::
Appears when document level security is enabled. 
Include groups and inherited users when indexing permissions.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling `Include groups and inherited users` will cause a signficant performance degradation.
====

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-documents-and-syncs]
=== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following objects and entities:

* *Files*
** Includes metadata such as file name, path, size, content, etc.
* *Folders*

[NOTE]
====
Due to a Dropbox issue, metadata updates to Paper files from Dropbox Paper are not immediately reflected in the Dropbox UI.
This delays the availability of updated results for the connector.
Once the metadata changes are visible in the Dropbox UI, the updates are available.
====

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Currently, the connector doesn't retrieve files from shared Team folders.
* Permissions are not synced by default. If <<dls, document level security (DLS)>> is not enabled *all documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-types]
==== Sync types

<<connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-rules]
=== Sync rules

<<sync-rules-basic, Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-rules-advanced]
==== Advanced sync rules

[NOTE]
====
A <<connectors-sync-types-full, full sync>> is required for advanced sync rules to take effect.
====

The following section describes <<sync-rules-advanced,advanced sync rules>> for this connector.

Advanced sync rules for Dropbox allow you to sync Dropbox files based on a query that matches strings in the filename.
You can optionally filter the results of the query by `file_extensions` or `file_categories`.
When both are provided, priority is given to `file_categories`.
We have some examples below for illustration.

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-rules-advanced-example-1]
===== Example: Query only

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "query": "confidential"
  },
  {

  {
    "query": "dropbox",
    "options": {
      "file_extensions": [
        "txt",
        "pdf"
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-rules-advanced-example-3]
===== Example: Query with file category filter

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "query": "test",
    "options": {
      "file_categories": [
        {
          ".tag": "paper"
        },
        {
          ".tag": "png"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

[discrete#connectors-dropbox-sync-rules-advanced-limitations]
===== Limitations

* Content extraction is not supported for Dropbox *Paper* files when advanced sync rules are enabled.

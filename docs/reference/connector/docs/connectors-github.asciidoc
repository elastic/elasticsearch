Server URL::
URL of the GitHub Server instance. (GitHub Server only)

Authentication method::
The method to authenticate the GitHub instance. Toggle between `Personal access token` and `GitHub App`.

Token::
GitHub personal access token to authenticate the GitHub instance. This field is only available for `Personal access token` authentication method.

Repository Type::
Toggle between `Organization` and `Other`.
Note that document level security (DLS) is only available for `Organization` repositories.

Organization Name::
Name of the organization to fetch data from. This field is only available when `Authentication method` is set to `Personal access token` and `Repository Type` is set to `Organization`.

* `*`
[TIP]
====
*Repository ownership*

If the "OWNER/" portion of the "OWNER/REPO" repository argument is omitted, it defaults to the name of the authenticating user.

In the examples provided here:

* the `elasticsearch` repo synced will be the `<OWNER>/elasticsearch` repo 
* the `kibana` repo synced will be the Elastic owned repo 

The "OWNER/" portion of the "OWNER/REPO" repository argument must be provided when `GitHub App` is selected as the `Authentication method`.

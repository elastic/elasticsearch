[discrete#connectors-github-compatability]
=== Compatibility

Both GitHub and GitHub Enterprise are supported.

[discrete#connectors-github-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required:

Data source::
Toggle between GitHub Cloud or GitHub Server.

Server URL::
URL of the GitHub Server instance. (GitHub Server only)

Authentication method::
The method to authenticate the GitHub instance. Toggle between `Personal access token` and `GitHub App`.

Token::
GitHub personal access token to authenticate the GitHub instance. This field is only available for `Personal access token` authentication method.

Repository Type::
Toggle between `Organization` and `Other`.
Note that document level security (DLS) is only available for `Organization` repositories.

Organization Name::
Name of the organization to fetch data from. This field is only available when `Authentication method` is set to `Personal access token` and `Repository Type` is set to `Organization`.

App ID::
App ID of the GitHub App. This field is only available when `Authentication method` is set to `GitHub App`.

App private key::
Private key generated for the GitHub App. This field is only available when `Authentication method` is set to `GitHub App`.

List of repositories::
Comma-separated list of repositories to fetch data from GitHub instance. If the value is `*` the connector will fetch data from all repositories present in the configured user's account.
+
Default value is `*`.
+
Examples:
+
* `elasticsearch`,`elastic/kibana`
* `*`
[TIP]
====
*Repository ownership*

If the "OWNER/" portion of the "OWNER/REPO" repository argument is omitted, it defaults to the name of the authenticating user.

In the examples provided here:

* the `elasticsearch` repo synced will be the `<OWNER>/elasticsearch` repo 
* the `kibana` repo synced will be the Elastic owned repo 

The "OWNER/" portion of the "OWNER/REPO" repository argument must be provided when `GitHub App` is selected as the `Authentication method`.
====
[NOTE]
====
This field can be bypassed by advanced sync rules.
====

Enable SSL::
Enable SSL for the GitHub instance.

SSL certificate::
SSL certificate for the GitHub instance. Example:
+
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID+jCCAuKgAwIBAgIGAJJMzlxLMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMHoxCzAJBgNVBAYT
...

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<dls, document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
DLS is only available when `Repository Type` is set to `Organization`.

[discrete#connectors-github-documents-syncs]
=== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following objects and entities:

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced. **All documents** indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to **all users with access** to that Elasticsearch Index.

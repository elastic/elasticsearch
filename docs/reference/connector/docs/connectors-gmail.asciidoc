For additional operations, see <<es-connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-connector-authentication-prerequisites]
===== Connector authentication prerequisites

Before syncing any data from GMail, you need to create a https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview[service account^] with appropriate access to the GMail and the Google Directory API, which is part of the Google Admin SDK API.
You also need to enable domain-wide delegation to impersonate the users you're fetching messages from.

To get started, log into https://cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Platform^] and go to the `Console`.

. *Create a Google Cloud Project.* Give your project a name, change the project ID and click the Create button.
. *Enable Google APIs.* Choose APIs & Services from the left menu and click on `Enable APIs and Services`. You need to enable *GMail API* and the *Google Admin SDK API*.
. *Create a Service Account.* In the `APIs & Services` section, click on `Credentials` and click on `Create credentials` to create a service account. Give your service account a name and a service account ID. This is like an email address and will be used to identify your service account in the future. Click `Done` to finish creating the service account.
+
Your service account needs to have access to at least the following scope:
+
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
. *Create a Key File*.
  * In the Cloud Console, go to `IAM and Admin` > `Service accounts` page.
  * Click the email address of the service account that you want to create a key for.
  * Click the `Keys` tab. Click the `Add key` drop-down menu, then select `Create new key`.
  * Select JSON as the Key type and then click `Create`. This will download a JSON file that will contain the service account credentials.

. *Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority*.
+
To access user data like messages on a Google Workspace domain, the service account that you created needs to be granted access by a super administrator for the domain. You can follow https://developers.google.com/cloud-search/docs/guides/delegation[the official documentation^] to perform Google Workspace domain-wide delegation of authority.
+
You need to grant the following *OAuth Scopes* to your service account:
+
--
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
--
+
This step allows the connector to access user data and their group memberships in your Google Workspace organization.

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-configuration]
===== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required:

GMail service account JSON::
The service account credentials generated from Google Cloud Platform (JSON string).
Refer to the https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account[Google Cloud documentation^] for more information.

Google Workspace admin email::
Google Workspace admin email.
Required to enable document level security (DLS).
A service account with delegated authority can impersonate an admin user with permissions to access Google Workspace user data and their group memberships.
Refer to the https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106?hl=en[Google Cloud documentation^] for more information.

Google customer ID::
Google customer id.
Required to fetch messages and to enable document level security (DLS).
Go to `Google Workspace Admin Console` -> `Account` and copy the value under `Customer Id`.

Include spam and trash emails::
Toggle to fetch spam and trash emails.
Also works with document level security (DLS).

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<es-dls,document level security (DLS>>.
DLS is supported for the GMail connector.
When enabled:
+
* Full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
* Access control syncs will fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-documents-and-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector will fetch all messages of all users the service account has access to.

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-sync-types]
====== Sync types

<<es-connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<es-connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

<<es-sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

Advanced sync rules are available for this connector.

For example:

[source,js]
----
{
  "messages": [
    "before:2021/10/10",
    "from:amy"
  ]
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

[discrete#es-connectors-gmail-document-level-security]
===== Document level security

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a user’s permissions.
Refer to <<es-connectors-gmail-configuration,configuration>> on this page for how to enable DLS for this connector.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<es-dls-e2e-guide, DLS in Search Applications>> to learn how to ingest data from a connector with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
The example uses SharePoint Online as the data source, but the same steps apply to every connector.

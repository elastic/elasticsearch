[%collapsible]
===============

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-availability-prerequisites]
===== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a *managed connector* on Elastic Cloud, as of *8.9.1*.

[NOTE]
====
Jira Data Center support was added in 8.13.0 in technical preview and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Technical preview features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
====

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<es-native-connectors-prerequisites,managed connector requirements>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-create-native-connector]
===== Create a {service-name} connector

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-usage]
===== Usage

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, see <<es-native-connectors>>.

For additional operations, see <<es-connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-compatability]
===== Compatibility

* Jira Cloud, Jira Server, and Jira Data Center *versions 7 or later*.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-configuration]

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

Jira data source::
Dropdown to determine the Jira platform type: `Jira Cloud`, `Jira Server`, or `Jira Data Center`. Default value is `Jira Cloud`.

Jira Data Center username::
The username of the account for Jira Data Center.

Jira Data Center password::
The password of the account to be used for Jira Data Center.

Jira Cloud service account id::
Email address to authenticate with Jira Cloud. Example: jane.doe@example.com

Jira Cloud API token::
The API Token to authenticate with Jira Cloud.

Jira Server username::
The username of the account for Jira Server.

Jira Server password::
The password of the account to be used for Jira Server.

Jira Cloud service account id::
The account email for Jira Cloud.

Jira Cloud API token::
The API Token to authenticate with Jira Cloud.

Jira host url::
The domain where Jira is hosted. Examples:

* https://192.158.1.38:8080/
* https://test_user.atlassian.net/

Jira project keys::
Comma-separated list of https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-an-issue/#Workingwithissues-Projectkeys[Project Keys^] to fetch data from Jira server or cloud. If the value is `*` the connector will fetch data from all projects present in the configured projects. Default value is `*`. Examples:

* `EC`, `TP`
* `*`

Enable SSL::
Whether SSL verification will be enabled. Default value is `False`.

SSL certificate::
Content of SSL certificate. Note: In case of `ssl_enabled` is `False`, the `ssl_ca` value will be ignored. Example certificate:
+
[source, txt]

...
7RhLQyWn2u00L7/9Omw=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<es-dls, document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
Access control syncs fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.
+
[NOTE]
====
To access user data in Jira Administration, the account you created must be granted *Product Access* for Jira Administration.
This access needs to be provided by an administrator from the http://admin.atlassian.com/[Atlassian Admin], and the access level granted should be `Product Admin`.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-documents-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following objects and entities:

* **Projects**
** Includes metadata such as description, project key, project type, lead name, etc.
* **Issues**
** All types of issues including Task, Bug, Sub-task, Enhancement, Story, etc.
** Includes metadata such as issue type, parent issue details, fix versions, affected versions, resolution, attachments, comments, sub-task details, priority, custom fields, etc.
* **Attachments**

**Note:** Archived projects and issues are not indexed.

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<es-connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced by default.
You must first enable <<es-connectors-jira-document-level-security,DLS>>.
Otherwise, *all documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-sync-types]
====== Sync types

<<es-connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<es-connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

<<es-sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

This connector supports <<es-sync-rules-advanced,advanced sync rules>> for remote filtering.
These rules cover complex query-and-filter scenarios that cannot be expressed with basic sync rules.
Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-sync-rules-examples]
====== Advanced sync rules example

*Example 1*: Queries to index content based on status of Jira issues.

[source,js]
----
[
  {
    "query": "project = Collaboration AND status = 'In Progress'"
  },
  {
    "query": "status IN ('To Do', 'In Progress', 'Closed')"
  }
]
----
// NOTCONSOLE

*Example 2*: Query to index data based on priority of issues for given projects.

[source,js]
----
[
  {
    "query": "priority in (Blocker, Critical) AND project in (ProjA, ProjB, ProjC)"
  }
]
----
// NOTCONSOLE

*Example 3*: Query to index data based on assignee and created time.

[source,js]
----
[
  {
    "query": "assignee is EMPTY and created < -1d"
  }
]
----
// NOTCONSOLE

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-document-level-security]
===== Document level security

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a user’s permissions.
Refer to <<es-connectors-jira-configuration,configuration>> on this page for how to enable DLS for this connector.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling DLS for your connector will cause a significant performance degradation, as the API calls to the data source required for this functionality are rate limited. This impacts the speed at which your content can be retrieved.
====

[WARNING]
====
When the `data_source` is set to Confluence Data Center or Server, the connector will only fetch 1000 users for access control syncs, due a https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-search/retrieve-users-with-get-users-endpoint#limitations[limitation in the API used^].
====

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<es-dls-e2e-guide, DLS in Search Applications>> to learn how to ingest data from a connector with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
The example uses SharePoint Online as the data source, but the same steps apply to every connector.

[discrete#es-connectors-jira-client-availability-prerequisites]
===== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a self-managed *self-managed connector*.
This self-managed connector is compatible with Elastic versions *8.7.0+*.

[NOTE]
====
Jira Data Center support was added in 8.13.0 in technical preview and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Technical preview features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

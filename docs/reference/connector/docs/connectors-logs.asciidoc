This document describes logs for <<es-native-connectors,managed connectors>> and <<es-build-connector,self-managed connectors>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-logs-enable]
==== Enable logs

[discrete#es-connectors-logs-enable-cloud]
===== Elastic Cloud

Elastic Cloud users need to {cloud}/ec-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html#ec-enable-logging-and-monitoring-steps[enable logging^] to view connector logs.
Go to *Cloud > Deployment > _your-deployment_ > Logs and metrics* to enable logs.

Once enabled, <<es-connectors-logs-view, you can view logs in Kibana>>.

Configure the `log_level` user setting for Enterprise Search. See {cloud}/ec-manage-enterprise-search-settings.html[Add Enterprise Search user settings^] in the Elastic Cloud documentation.

[discrete#es-connectors-logs-enable-self-managed]
===== self-managed connectors

Note that self-managed deployments and self-managed connector logs are written to `STDOUT`.

Self-managed connectors have the following logging options:

* Use the `service.log_level` setting in your connector service configuration file to specify the log level for the service.
** Enable `elasticsearch.bulk.enable_operations_logging` to log the result of sending documents to Elasticsearch from connectors, for auditing and debugging. This setting depends on the `service.log_level` and will be logged at `DEBUG` level .
* Use the `elasticsearch.log_level` setting to specify the log level for the Elasticsearch _client_ used by the connector service.

[discrete#es-connectors-logs-view]

You can filter by `service.type`:

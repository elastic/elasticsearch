[#es-native-connectors]
== Elastic managed connectors

.Naming history
****
Elastic managed connectors were initially known as "native connectors".
You might find this term in older documentation.
****

Managed <<es-connectors,Elastic connectors>> are available directly within your Elastic Cloud deployment.
No additional infrastructure is required.

Managed connectors sync data sources directly to Elasticsearch indices.
Create these indices using the *Connector* workflow within {kib}.

The following connectors are available as Elastic managed connectors.
Refer to each connector reference for additional information specific to each connector.

include::_connectors-list-native.asciidoc[]

[discrete#es-native-connectors-prerequisites]
=== Availability and prerequisites

Managed connectors were introduced in Elastic version *8.5.0*.

Your Elastic Cloud deployment must include the following Elastic services:

* *Elasticsearch*
* *{kib}*
* {enterprise-search-ref}/server.html[*Enterprise Search*]

Refer to _Native Integrations_ on the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud[Elastic subscriptions page], in the *Elastic Search* section for managed connector licensing requirements.

.Elastic Cloud IPs
[sidebar]
--
Using our Elastic managed connectors involves outbound data transfer (egress) from your Elastic Cloud deployment.
If you have IP/firewall rules on your third party service, you'll need to add the Elastic Cloud egress static IP ranges to your serviceâ€™s configuration.

Refer to {cloud}/ec-static-ips.html[static IP ranges] in the Elastic Cloud documentation for the latest list of IP addresses.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-usage]
=== Usage in {kib} UI

Follow the *Connector* workflow in {kib} to select the *Connector* ingestion method.
Choose a data source, create an Elasticsearch index, and configure a managed connector to manage the index.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-select-connector]
==== Select a connector

Choose the data source to sync from the available options and select *Continue*.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-index]
==== Create index

Create a new index to be managed by the connector:

. Name your index and optionally change the language analyzer to match the human language of your data source.
(The index name will be automatically prefixed with `search-`.)
. Select *Create index*.

The index is created and ready to <<es-native-connectors-configuration,configure>>.

This operation requires:

. Access to {kib}
. Permission to create or manage the index
. `write` {ref}/security-privileges.html[indices privilege^] for the `.elastic-connectors` index
. `manage_api_key` {ref}/security-privileges.html[cluster privilege^] to allow the API key to be created
. `write_connector_secrets` {ref}/security-privileges.html[cluster privilege^] to allow the API key to be stored as a secret

[discrete#es-native-connectors-configuration]
==== Configure connector

Create a new index to be managed by the connector.

Continue from above, or navigate to the following location within the {kib} UI:

*Search > Content > Elasticsearch indices*

Choose the index to configure, and then choose the *Configuration* tab.

Configure the connector:

. Edit the name and description for the connector.
Your team can use this information to differentiate this index from other connector indices.
(These fields describe the _connector_ and are independent of the Elasticsearch index name.)
. Save your changes.
. Edit the data source configuration.
The fields here vary by connector.
Refer to the documentation for each connector for details (refer to list of Elastic managed connectors, above).
Refer to <<es-connectors-security>> for security considerations.
. Save your changes.

Optionally choose *Edit sync schedule* to begin <<es-native-connectors-management,managing the connector>>.

This operation requires:

. Access to {kib}
. Permission to create or manage the index
. `write` {ref}/security-privileges.html[indices privilege^] for the `.elastic-connectors` index
. `manage_api_key` {ref}/security-privileges.html[cluster privilege^] to allow the API key to be created
. `write_connector_secrets` {ref}/security-privileges.html[cluster privilege^] to allow the API key to be stored as a secret

[discrete#es-native-connectors-management]
==== Manage connector

To manage documents, syncs, sync rules, ingest pipelines, and other connector features, refer to <<es-connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-manage-API-keys]
=== Manage API keys

[NOTE]
====
API keys for Elastic managed connectors were introduced in Elastic version *8.13.0*.
Managed connectors created in earlier versions will not automatically use API keys upon upgrading to *8.13.0*.
Refer to <<es-native-connectors-enabling-API-keys-for-upgraded-connectors,enabling API keys>> for more information.
====

Managed connectors communicate with Elasticsearch using API keys.
When managing a managed connector through the Connectors page in the {kib} UI, API key management is handled automatically.
API keys for Elastic managed connectors have the `manage` permission for three indices:

. The attached index
. The access control (ACL) index used for document level security
. The internal `.elastic-connectors` index.

Changing the attached index through {kib} will automatically invalidate the existing API key and generate a new one.
If you want to rotate an existing API key, navigate to the *Configuration* tab.
Scroll down to *Manage API key* and select *Generate API key*.
This action will invalidate the previous API key, create a new API key, and update the connector secret.

API keys for Elastic managed connectors are stored on an internal system index called `.connector-secrets`.
This index can only be written to through API requests by users with the `write_connector-secrets` cluster privilege.
Only the Enterprise Search instance has permission to read from this index.

Users managing Elastic managed connectors will need the `write_connector_secrets` cluster privilege assigned to their role.
Refer to <<es-connectors-security>> for security considerations.

==== Manage API keys programmatically

You can also create and store API keys programmatically.

.*Expand* the following section for details.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-enabling-API-keys-for-upgraded-connectors]
==== Enabling API keys for upgraded connectors

Managed connectors created before *8.13.0* do not initially have API keys upon upgrading.
The attached indices of these connectors cannot be changed until the connector has been converted to use an API key.

.*Expand* the following section for steps on enabling API keys for upgraded Elastic managed connectors.
[%collapsible]
===================================
. Run the following command in *Dev Tools* to enable API keys for the connector, replacing values where indicated.

// TEST[skip:requires connector_id]

. Go back to the Connectors page and navigate to the *Configuration* tab.
. Scroll down to *Manage API key* and select *Generate API key*.

Your managed connector is now using API keys to authorize ingestion into Elasticsearch.
===================================

[discrete#es-native-connectors-usage-api]
=== Usage via API

In 8.12 we introduced a set of {ref}/connector-apis.html[Connector APIs] to create and manage Elastic connectors and sync jobs, along with a https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/main/docs/CLI.md[CLI tool].
Use these tools if you'd like to work with connectors and sync jobs programmatically.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-example]
=== End-to-end example

The following example demonstrates how to use a managed connector on Elastic Cloud: <<es-mongodb-start>>.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-convert]
=== Convert a managed connector

You can convert a managed connector to a self-managed connector to be run on your own infrastructure.
You'll find instructions in the UI on the connector index's overview page.

[WARNING]
====
Converting a managed connector to a self-managed connector is an irreversible operation!

[%collapsible]
===============

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-prerequisites]
===== Availability and prerequisites

This connector is available as a *managed connector* on Elastic Cloud, as of *8.9.1*.

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<es-native-connectors-prerequisites,managed connector requirements>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-usage]
===== Usage

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, see <<es-native-connectors>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-configuration]
===== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

Username::
The username of the account for the network drive.
The user must have at least **read** permissions for the folder path provided.

Password::
The password of the account to be used for crawling the network drive.

IP address::
The server IP address where the network drive is hosted.
Default value is `127.0.0.1`.

Port::
The server port where the network drive service is available.
Default value is `445`.

Path::
** The network drive path the connector will crawl to fetch files.
This is the name of the folder shared via SMB.
The connector uses the Python https://github.com/jborean93/smbprotocol[`smbprotocol`^] library which supports both *SMB v2* and *v3*.
** Accepts only one pathâ€” parent folders can be specified to widen the scope.
** The drive path should use *forward slashes* as path separators.
Example:
+
* `admin/bin`

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable document level security (DLS). When enabled:
* Full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
* Access control syncs will fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.
Default value is `false`.
+
[TIP]
====
Refer to <<es-connectors-network-drive-dls, Document level security>> for more information, including prerequisites and limitations.
====

Identity mappings::
Path to a CSV file containing user and group SIDs (For Linux Network Drive).
+
File should be formatted as follows:
+
* Fields separated by semicolons (`;`)
* Three fields per line: `Username;User-SID;Group-SIDs`
* Group-SIDs are comma-separated and optional.
+
*Example* with one username, user-sid and no group:
+
[source,text]
----
user1;S-1;
----
+
*Example* with one username, user-sid and two groups:
+
[source,text]
----
user1;S-1;S-11,S-22
----

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-documents-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs folders as separate documents in Elasticsearch.
The following fields will be added for the document type `folder`:

* `create_time`
* `title`
* `path`
* `modified`
* `time`
* `id`

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<es-connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced by default.
You must first enable <<es-connectors-network-drive-client-dls,DLS>>.
Otherwise, *all documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-sync-types]
====== Sync types

<<es-connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<es-connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-dls]
===== Document level security

Document Level Security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a user's permissions.
DLS facilitates the syncing of folder and file permissions, including both user and group level permissions.

[NOTE]
====
**Note:** Refer to <<es-dls-e2e-guide,DLS in Search Applications>> to learn how to search data with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-dls-availability]
====== Availability

* The present version of Network Drive connector offers DLS support for Windows network drives only.
* To fetch users and groups in a Windows network drive, account credentials added in the connector configuration should have access to the Powershell of the Windows Server where the network drive is hosted.

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

<<es-sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

[discrete#es-connectors-network-drive-sync-rules-advanced]
====== Advanced sync rules

[NOTE]
====
A <<es-connectors-sync-types-full, full sync>> is required for advanced sync rules to take effect.
====

Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.
Advanced sync rules for this connector use *glob patterns*.

1. Each rule must contains a glob pattern. This pattern is then matched against all the available folder paths inside the configured drive path.
2. The pattern must begin with the `drive_path` field configured in the connector.
3. If the pattern matches any available folder paths, the contents directly within those folders will be fetched.

The following sections provide examples of advanced sync rules for this connector.

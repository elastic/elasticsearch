[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-availability-and-prerequisites]
===== Availability and prerequisites

This managed connector was introduced in Elastic *8.14.0* as a managed service on Elastic Cloud.

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, satisfy all <<es-native-connectors,managed connector requirements>>.

[NOTE]
====
This connector is in *beta* and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-usage]
===== Usage

To use this connector in the UI, select the *Notion* tile when creating a new connector under *Search -> Connectors*.

If you're already familiar with how connectors work, you can also use the {ref}/connector-apis.html[Connector APIs].

For additional operations, see <<es-connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-connecting-to-notion]
===== Connecting to Notion

To connect to Notion, the user needs to https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api#create-an-internal-integration[create an internal integration] for their Notion workspace, which can access resources using the Internal Integration Secret Token. Configure the Integration with following settings:

1. Users must grant `READ` permission for content, comment and user capabilities for that integration from the Capabilities tab.

2. Users must manually https://www.notion.so/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api#add-connections-to-pages[add the integration as a connection] to the top-level pages in a workspace. Sub-pages will inherit the connections of the parent page automatically.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-configuration]
===== Configuration

Note the following configuration fields:

`Notion Secret Key`(required)::
Secret token assigned to your integration, for a particular workspace. Example:

* `zyx-123453-12a2-100a-1123-93fd09d67394`

`Databases`(required)::
Comma-separated list of database names to be fetched by the connector. If the value is `*`, connector will fetch all the databases available in the workspace. Example:

* `database1, database2`
* `*`

`Pages`(required)::
Comma-separated list of page names to be fetched by the connector. If the value is `*`, connector will fetch all the pages available in the workspace. Examples:

* `*`
* `Page1, Page2`

`Index Comments`::

Toggle to enable fetching and indexing of comments from the Notion workspace for the configured pages, databases and the corresponding child blocks. Default value is `False`.

[NOTE]
====
Enabling comment indexing could impact connector performance due to increased network calls. Therefore, by default this value is `False`. 
====

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-content-extraction]
====== Content Extraction

Refer to <<es-connectors-content-extraction,content extraction>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-documents-and-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following objects and entities:

* *Pages*
** Includes metadata such as `page name`, `id`, `last updated time`, etc.
* *Blocks*
** Includes metadata such as `title`, `type`, `id`, `content` (in case of file block), etc.
* *Databases*
** Includes metadata such as `name`, `id`, `records`, `size`, etc.
* *Users*
** Includes metadata such as `name`, `id`, `email address`, etc.
* *Comments*
** Includes the content and metadata such as `id`, `last updated time`, `created by`, etc.
** *Note*: Comments are excluded by default.

[NOTE]
====
* Files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted.
* Permissions are not synced. *All documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to the relevant Elasticsearch index.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

<<es-sync-rules-basic,Basic sync rules>> are identical for all connectors and are available by default.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-advanced-sync-rules]
===== Advanced sync rules

[NOTE]
====
A <<es-connectors-sync-types-full, full sync>> is required for advanced sync rules to take effect.
====

The following section describes *advanced sync rules* for this connector, to filter data in Notion _before_ indexing into {es}. 
Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.

Advanced sync rules for Notion take the following parameters:

1. `searches`: Notion's search filter to search by title.
2. `query`: Notion's database query filter to fetch a specific database.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-connector-known-issues]
===== Known issues

* *Updates to new pages may not be reflected immediately in the Notion API.*
+
This could lead to these pages not being indexed by the connector, if a sync is initiated immediately after their addition.
To ensure all pages are indexed, initiate syncs a few minutes after adding pages to Notion.

* *Notion's Public API does not support linked databases.*
+
Linked databases in Notion are copies of a database that can be filtered, sorted, and viewed differently.
To fetch the information in a linked database, you need to target the original *source* database.
For more details refer to the https://developers.notion.com/docs/working-with-databases#linked-databases[Notion documentation].

* *Documents' `properties` objects are serialized as strings under `details`*.
+
Notion's schema for `properties` is not consistent, and can lead to `document_parsing_exceptions` if indexed to Elasticsearch as an object.
For this reason, the `properties` object is instead serialized as a JSON string, and stored under the `details` field.
If you need to search a sub-object from `properties`, you may need to post-process the `details` field in an ingest pipeline to extract your desired subfield(s).

Refer to <<es-connectors-known-issues>> for a list of known issues for all connectors.

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-client-connector-availability-and-prerequisites]
===== Availability and prerequisites

This connector was introduced in Elastic *8.13.0*, available as a *self-managed* self-managed connector.

To use this connector, satisfy all <<es-build-connector, self-managed connector prerequisites>>.
Importantly, you must deploy the connectors service on your own infrastructure.
You have two deployment options:

* <<es-connectors-run-from-source, Run connectors service from source>>. Use this option if you're comfortable working with Python and want to iterate quickly locally.
* <<es-connectors-run-from-docker, Run connectors service in Docker>>. Use this option if you want to deploy the connectors to a server, or use a container orchestration platform. 

[NOTE]
====
This connector is in *beta* and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

===== Connector Client operations

[discrete#es-connectors-notion-client-connector-end-to-end-testing]
====== End-to-end Testing

The connector framework enables operators to run functional tests against a real data source, using Docker Compose.
You don't need a running Elasticsearch instance or Notion source to run this test.

Refer to <<es-build-connector-testing>> for more details.

To perform E2E testing for the Notion connector, run the following command:


[source,shell]
----
$ make ftest NAME=notion
----

For faster tests, add the `DATA_SIZE=small` flag:

[source,shell]
----
make ftest NAME=notion DATA_SIZE=small
----

By default, `DATA_SIZE=MEDIUM`.

===== Usage

To use this connector natively in Elastic Cloud, see <<es-native-connectors>>.

For additional operations, see <<es-connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-usage-connection]
====== Connecting to OneDrive

To connect to OneDrive you need to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal[create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal] that can access resources.

Follow these steps:

. Go to the https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal] and sign in with your Azure account.
. Navigate to the *Azure Active Directory* service.
. Select *App registrations* from the left-hand menu.
. Click on the *New registration* button to register a new application.
. Provide a name for your app, and optionally select the supported account types (e.g., single tenant, multi-tenant).
. Click on the *Register* button to create the app registration.
. After the registration is complete, you will be redirected to the app's overview page. Take note of the *Application (client) ID* value, as you'll need it later.
. Scroll down to the *API permissions* section and click on the *Add a permission* button.
. In the *Request API permissions* pane, select *Microsoft Graph* as the API.
. Choose the application permissions and select the following permissions under the *Application* tab: `User.Read.All`, `File.Read.All`
. Click on the *Add permissions* button to add the selected permissions to your app.
Finally, click on the *Grant admin consent* button to grant the required permissions to the app. This step requires administrative privileges. **NOTE**: If you are not an admin, you need to request the Admin to grant consent via their Azure Portal.
. Click on *Certificates & Secrets* tab. Go to Client Secrets. Generate a new client secret and keep a note of the string present under `Value` column.

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-usage-configuration]
===== Configuration

The following configuration fields are *required*:

Azure application Client ID::
Unique identifier for your Azure Application, found on the app's overview page. Example:
* `ab123453-12a2-100a-1123-93fd09d67394`

Azure application Client Secret::
String value that the application uses to prove its identity when requesting a token, available under the `Certificates & Secrets` tab of your Azure application menu. Example:
* `eyav1~12aBadIg6SL-STDfg102eBfCGkbKBq_Ddyu`

Azure application Tenant ID::
Unique identifier of your Azure Active Directory instance. Example:
* `123a1b23-12a3-45b6-7c8d-fc931cfb448d`

Enable document level security::
Toggle to enable <<es-dls,document level security>>.
When enabled:
* Full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field.
* Access control syncs will fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling DLS for your connector will cause a significant performance degradation, as the API calls to the data source required for this functionality are rate limited.
This impacts the speed at which your content can be retrieved.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-usage-content-extraction]
===== Content Extraction

Refer to <<es-connectors-content-extraction, Content extraction>> for more details.

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-documents-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following objects and entities:

* *Files*
** Includes metadata such as file name, path, size, content, etc.
* *Folders*

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted. (Self-managed connectors can use the <<es-connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.)
* Permissions are not synced by default.
You must first enable <<es-connectors-onedrive-client-dls,DLS>>.
Otherwise, *all documents* indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to *all users with access* to that Elastic Deployment.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-connectors-onedrive-sync-types]
====== Sync types

<<es-connectors-sync-types-full,Full syncs>> are supported by default for all connectors.

This connector also supports <<es-connectors-sync-types-incremental,incremental syncs>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-dls]
===== Document level security

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents based on a userâ€™s permissions. This feature is available by default for the OneDrive connector.
See <<es-connectors-onedrive-usage-configuration>> for how to enable DLS for this connector.

Refer to <<es-dls,document level security>> for more details about this feature.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to <<es-dls-e2e-guide>> to learn how to ingest data with DLS enabled, when building a search application.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-documents-sync-rules]
===== Sync rules

_Basic_ sync rules are identical for all connectors and are available by default.
For more information read <<es-sync-rules-types>>.

[discrete#es-connectors-onedrive-sync-rules-advanced]
====== Advanced sync rules

This connector supports <<es-sync-rules-advanced,advanced sync rules>> for remote filtering.
These rules cover complex query-and-filter scenarios that cannot be expressed with basic sync rules.
Advanced sync rules are defined through a source-specific DSL JSON snippet.

[NOTE]
====
A <<es-connectors-sync-types-full, full sync>> is required for advanced sync rules to take effect.
====

Here are a few examples of advanced sync rules for this connector.

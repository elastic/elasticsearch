[WARNING]
====
This connector is an *example connector* that serves as a building block for customizations and is subject to change.
Its source code currently lives on a https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/opentext-connector-backup/connectors/sources/opentext_documentum.py[feature branch] and is yet not part of the main Elastic Connectors codebase.
The design and code is less mature than supported features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. 
This connector is not subject to the support SLA of supported features.
====

The Elastic OpenText Documentum connector is written in Python using the https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#connector-framework[Elastic connector framework]. View the https://github.com/elastic/connectors/blob/opentext-connector-backup/connectors/sources/opentext_documentum.py[source code] for this example connector.

[discrete#es-connectors-opentext-documentum-connector-availability-and-prerequisites]
==== Availability and prerequisites

This *example connector* was introduced in Elastic *8.14.0*, available as a *self-managed* self-managed connector on a feature branch, for testing and development purposes only.

To use this connector, satisfy all <<es-build-connector, self-managed connector prerequisites>>.
Importantly, you must deploy the connectors service on your own infrastructure.
You have two deployment options:

* <<es-connectors-run-from-source, Run connectors service from source>>. Use this option if you're comfortable working with Python and want to iterate quickly locally.
* <<es-connectors-run-from-docker, Run connectors service in Docker>>. Use this option if you want to deploy the connectors to a server, or use a container orchestration platform.

[discrete#es-connectors-opentext-documentum-connector-usage]
==== Usage

To set up this connector in the UI, select the *OpenText Documentum* tile when creating a new connector under *Search -> Connectors*.

If you're already familiar with how connectors work, you can also use the {ref}/connector-apis.html[Connector APIs].

For additional operations, see <<es-connectors-usage>>.

==== Connector Client operations

[discrete#es-connectors-opentext-documentum-connector-end-to-end-testing]
===== End-to-end Testing

The connector framework enables operators to run functional tests against a real data source, using Docker Compose.
You don't need a running Elasticsearch instance or OpenText Documentum source to run this test.

Refer to <<es-build-connector-testing>> for more details.

To perform E2E testing for the OpenText Documentum connector, run the following command:

```shell
$ make ftest NAME=opentext_documentum
```
For faster tests, add the `DATA_SIZE=small` flag:

[source,shell]
----
make ftest NAME=opentext_documentum DATA_SIZE=small
----

By default, `DATA_SIZE=MEDIUM`.

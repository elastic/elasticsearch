== Enterprise Search is discontinued in Elastic 9.0.0

Elastic 9.0.0 and 8.18.0 are released at the same time.
Please note that Enterprise Search is not available in Elastic 9.0+, including App Search, Workplace Search, the Elastic Web Crawler, and Elastic managed connectors.
If you are an Enterprise Search user and want to upgrade to Elastic 9.0, refer to https://www.elastic.co/resources/search/enterprise-search-faq#what-features-are-impacted-by-this-announcement[our Enterprise Search FAQ].
It includes detailed steps, tooling, and resources to help you transition to supported alternatives in 9.x, such as Elasticsearch, the Open Web Crawler, and self-managed connectors.

See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2967[*PR 2967*].

See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2984[*PR 2984*].

=== 8.16.0

[discrete]
[[es-connectors-release-notes-deprecation-notice]]
==== Deprecation notices

* *Direct index access for connectors and sync jobs*
+
IMPORTANT: Directly accessing connector and sync job state through `.elastic-connectors*` indices is deprecated, and will be disallowed entirely in a future release.

* Instead, the Elasticsearch Connector APIs should be used. Connectors framework code now uses the <<connector-apis,Connector APIs>> by default.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2884[*PR 2902*].

* *Docker `enterprise-search` namespace deprecation*
+
IMPORTANT: The `enterprise-search` Docker namespace is deprecated and will be discontinued in a future release. 
+
Starting in `8.16.0`, Docker images are being transitioned to the new `integrations` namespace, which will become the sole location for future releases. This affects the https://github.com/elastic/connectors[Elastic Connectors] and https://github.com/elastic/data-extraction-service[Elastic Data Extraction Service].
+
During this transition period, images are published to both namespaces:
+
** *Example*:
+
Deprecated namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/enterprise-search/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`
+
New namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/integrations/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`
+
Users should migrate to the new `integrations` namespace as soon as possible to ensure continued access to future releases.

[[es-connectors-release-notes-8-16-0-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* Docker images now use Chainguard's Wolfi base image (`docker.elastic.co/wolfi/jdk:openjdk-11-dev`), replacing the previous `ubuntu:focal` base.

* The Sharepoint Online connector now works with the `Sites.Selected` permission instead of the broader permission `Sites.Read.All`.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2762[*PR 2762*].

* Starting in 8.16.0, connectors will start using proper SEMVER, with `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, which aligns with Elasticsearch/Kibana versions. This drops the previous `.BUILD` suffix, which we used to release connectors between Elastic stack releases. Going forward, these inter-stack-release releases will be suffixed instead with `+<timestamp>`, aligning with Elastic Agent and conforming to SEMVER. 
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2749[*PR 2749*].

* Connector logs now use UTC timestamps, instead of machine-local timestamps. This only impacts logging output.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2695[*PR 2695*].

==== Bug fixes

* The Dropbox connector now fetches the files from team shared folders.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2718[*PR 2718*].

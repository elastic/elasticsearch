.Resolves missing access control for “Everyone Except External Users” in SharePoint connector
[%collapsible]
====
Permissions granted to the “Everyone Except External Users” group were previously ignored, causing incomplete access control metadata in documents. This occurred because the connector did not recognize the group’s login name format.
PR https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/3577[*#3577*] resolves this issue by recognizing the group’s login format and correctly applying its permissions to document access control metadata.

[[es-connectors-release-notes-deprecation-notice]]
==== Deprecation notices

* *Direct index access for connectors and sync jobs*
+
IMPORTANT: Directly accessing connector and sync job state through `.elastic-connectors*` indices is deprecated, and will be disallowed entirely in a future release.

* Instead, the Elasticsearch Connector APIs should be used. Connectors framework code now uses the <<connector-apis,Connector APIs>> by default.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2884[*PR 2902*].

* *Docker `enterprise-search` namespace deprecation*
+
IMPORTANT: The `enterprise-search` Docker namespace is deprecated and will be discontinued in a future release. 
+
Starting in `8.16.0`, Docker images are being transitioned to the new `integrations` namespace, which will become the sole location for future releases. This affects the https://github.com/elastic/connectors[Elastic Connectors] and https://github.com/elastic/data-extraction-service[Elastic Data Extraction Service].
+
During this transition period, images are published to both namespaces:
+
** *Example*:
+
Deprecated namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/enterprise-search/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`
+
New namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/integrations/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`
+
Users should migrate to the new `integrations` namespace as soon as possible to ensure continued access to future releases.

[[es-connectors-release-notes-8-16-0-enhancements]]
==== Enhancements

* Connectors now support working with index aliases.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2796[*PR 2796*].

* Docker images now use Chainguard's Wolfi base image (`docker.elastic.co/wolfi/jdk:openjdk-11-dev`), replacing the previous `ubuntu:focal` base.

* The Sharepoint Online connector now works with the `Sites.Selected` permission instead of the broader permission `Sites.Read.All`.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2762[*PR 2762*].

* Starting in 8.16.0, connectors will start using proper SEMVER, with `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, which aligns with Elasticsearch/Kibana versions. This drops the previous `.BUILD` suffix, which we used to release connectors between Elastic stack releases. Going forward, these inter-stack-release releases will be suffixed instead with `+<timestamp>`, aligning with Elastic Agent and conforming to SEMVER. 
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2749[*PR 2749*].

* Connector logs now use UTC timestamps, instead of machine-local timestamps. This only impacts logging output.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2695[*PR 2695*].

==== Bug fixes

* The Dropbox connector now fetches the files from team shared folders.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2718[*PR 2718*].

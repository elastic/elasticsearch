This document describes security considerations for <<es-native-connectors,managed connectors>> and <<es-build-connector,self-managed connectors>>.

Elastic Cloud deployments have strong security defaults.
For example, data is encrypted by default, whether at rest or in transit.

Self-managed deployments require more upfront work to ensure strong security.
Refer to {ref}/secure-cluster.html[Secure the Elastic Stack^] in the Elasticsearch documentation for more information.

==== Access to credentials

Credentials for the data source — such as API keys or username/password pair— are stored in your deployment's `.elastic-connectors` Elasticsearch index.
Therefore, the credentials are visible to all Elastic users with the `read` {ref}/security-privileges.html[indices privilege^] for that index.
By default, the following Elastic users have this privilege: the `elastic` superuser and the `kibana_system` user.
Enterprise Search service account tokens can also read the `.elastic-connectors` index.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-security-api-key]
==== Access to internally stored API keys

API keys for Elastic managed connectors are stored in the internal system index `.connector-secrets`.
Access to this index is restricted to authorized API calls only.
The cluster privilege `write_connector_secrets` is required to store or update secrets through the API.
Only the Enterprise Search instance has permission to read from this index.

===== Document-level security

Document-level security is available for a subset of connectors.
DLS is available by default for the following connectors:

include::_connectors-list-dls.asciidoc[]

Learn more about this feature in <<es-dls>>, including availability and prerequisites.

==== Access to documents

Data synced from your data source are stored as documents in the Elasticsearch index you created.
This data is visible to all Elastic users with the `read` {ref}/security-privileges.html[indices privilege^] for that index.
Be careful to ensure that access to this index is _at least_ as restrictive as access to the original data source.

[discrete#es-native-connectors-security-encryption]
==== Encryption

Elastic Cloud automatically encrypts data at rest.
Data in transit is automatically encrypted using `https`.

Self-managed deployments must implement encryption at rest.
See {ref}/configuring-stack-security.html[Configure security for the Elastic Stack^] in the Elasticsearch documentation for more information.

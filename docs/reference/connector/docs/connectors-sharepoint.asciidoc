The following configuration fields are required to set up the connector:

`username`::
The username of the account for the SharePoint Server instance.

`password`::
The password of the account.

* `collection1`
* `collection1, collection2`

`ssl_enabled`::
Whether SSL verification will be enabled.
Default value is `False`.

Content of SSL certificate needed for SharePoint Server.
Keep this field empty, if `ssl_enabled` is set to `False`.
+
Example certificate:
+
[source, txt]

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

`retry_count`::
The number of retry attempts after a failed request to the SharePoint Server instance. Default value is `3`.

`use_document_level_security`::
Toggle to enable <<es-dls, Document level security (DLS)>>.
When enabled, full syncs will fetch access control lists for each document and store them in the `_allow_access_control` field. Access control syncs fetch users' access control lists and store them in a separate index.
+
Once enabled, the following granular permissions toggles will be available:
+
** *Fetch unique list permissions*: Enable this option to fetch unique *list* permissions. If this setting is disabled a list will inherit permissions from its parent site.
** *Fetch unique list item permissions*: Enable this option to fetch unique *list item* permissions. If this setting is disabled a list item will inherit permissions from its parent site.
+
[NOTE]
====
If left empty the default value `true` will be used for these granular permissions toggles.
Note that these settings may increase sync times.
====

[discrete#es-connectors-sharepoint-documents-syncs]
===== Documents and syncs

The connector syncs the following SharePoint object types:

* Sites and Subsites
* Lists
* List Items and its attachment content
* Document Libraries and its attachment content(include Web Pages)

[NOTE]
====
* Content from files bigger than 10 MB won't be extracted by default. Use the <<es-connectors-content-extraction-local, self-managed local extraction service>> to handle larger binary files.
* Permissions are not synced. **All documents** indexed to an Elastic deployment will be visible to **all users with access** to that Elasticsearch Index.

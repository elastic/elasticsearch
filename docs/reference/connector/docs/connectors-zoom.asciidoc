[discrete#connectors-zoom-connector-usage]
=== Usage

To use this connector in the UI, select the *Zoom* tile when creating a new connector under *Search -> Connectors*.

If you're already familiar with how connectors work, you can also use the {ref}/connector-apis.html[Connector APIs].

For additional operations, see <<connectors-usage>>.

[discrete#connectors-zoom-connector-connecting-to-zoom]
=== Connecting to Zoom

To connect to Zoom you need to https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/s2s-oauth/[create an Server-to-Server OAuth application] that can access resources. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the https://marketplace.zoom.us/[Zoom App Marketplace] and sign in with your Zoom account.
2. Navigate to the "Develop" service.
3. Select "Build App" from the dropdown menu.	
4. Click on the "Server-to-Server OAuth" button to register a new application.
5. Provide a name for your app.
6. Click on the "Create" button to create the app registration.
7. After the registration is complete, you will be redirected to the app's overview page. Take note of the "App Credentials" value, as you'll need it later.
8. Navigate to the "Scopes" section and click on the "Add Scopes" button.
9. The following scopes need to be added to the app.
+
[source,bash]
----
user:read:admin
meeting:read:admin
chat_channel:read:admin
recording:read:admin
chat_message:read:admin
report:read:admin
----

10. Click on the "Done" button to add the selected scopes to your app.
11. Navigate to the "Activation" section and input the necessary information to activate the app.

After completion, use the following configuration parameters to configure the connector.

[discrete#connectors-zoom-connector-configuration]
=== Configuration

The following configuration fields are required:

`Zoom application Account ID`::  (required)
"Account ID" is a unique identifier associated with a specific Zoom account within the Zoom platform, found on the app's overview page. Example:

* `KVx-aQssTOutOAGrDfgMaA`

`Zoom application Client ID`::  (required)
"Client ID" refers to a unique identifier associated with an application that integrates with the Zoom platform, found on the app's overview page. Example:

* `49Z69_rnRiaF4JYyfHusw`

`Zoom application Client Secret`::  (required)
The "Client Secret" refers to a confidential piece of information generated when developers register an application on the Zoom Developer Portal for integration with the Zoom platform, found on the app's overview page. Example:

* `eieiUJRsiH543P5NbYadavczjkqgdRTw`

`Recording Age Limit (Months)`::  (required)
How far back in time to request recordings from Zoom. Recordings older than this will not be indexed. This configuration parameter allows you to define a time limit, measured in months, for which recordings will be indexed.

`Fetch past meeting details`::
Retrieve more information about previous meetings, including their details and participants. Default value is `False`. Enable this option to fetch past meeting details. This setting can increase sync time.

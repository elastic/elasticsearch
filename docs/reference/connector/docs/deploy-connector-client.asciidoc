[#deploy-connector-client]
= Deploying self-managed connectors

To use connector clients in a self-managed environment, you must deploy the connector service.
The source code is hosted in the https://github.com/elastic/connectors[elastic/connectors^] repository.

You have two deployment options:

* <<connectors-run-from-source, Running the connectors from source>>. Use this option if you're comfortable working with Python and want to iterate quickly locally.
* <<connectors-run-from-docker, Running the connectors from Docker>>. Use this option if you want to deploy the connectors to a server, or use a container orchestration platform.

.Connectors documentation history
****
Please note that the connectors documentation lived in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.15/connectors-references.html[Enterprise Search documentation] prior to version 8.16.0.
****

A _connector_ is a type of https://www.elastic.co/integrations/data-integrations[Elastic integration^] that syncs content from an original data source to an *Elasticsearch index*. 
Connectors enable you to create _searchable_, read-only replicas of your data sources.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These connectors are focused on general content, which is non-timestamped data.
Refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-cloud-ingest-data.html[add data to {es}] if you're interested in ingesting timestamped data.
====

Connectors extract the original files, records, or objects; and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents.

Many connectors are available out-of-the-box on Elastic Cloud.
You can also access the source code for these (and additional) connectors, and run them on your own infrastructure.

* **Managed connectors** are available directly within your Elastic Cloud deployment.
* **Self-managed connectors** are self-managed on your own infrastructure.

[discrete#es-connectors-native]
== Elastic managed connectors {ess-icon}

_Managed connectors_ are available directly within your Elastic Cloud deployment, as a managed service.
No additional infrastructure is required.

Please note that Elastic managed connectors were previously known as "native connectors".

Refer to <<es-native-connectors,Elastic managed connectors>> for details on how to configure and use Elastic managed connectors.

[discrete#es-connectors-build]
== Self-managed connectors

Self-managed connectors enable you to run connectors locally on your own infrastructure.
This means you can try out new connectors before they are available natively within Elastic Cloud, and/or customize existing connectors.

Please note that self-managed connectors were previously known as "connector clients".

Refer to <<es-build-connector>> for details on how to deploy self-managed connectors.

[discrete#es-connectors-overview-framework]
== Connector framework

All Elastic connectors are built using our Python connector framework.
The source code is available in the {connectors-python}[`elastic/connectors`] repository on GitHub.

The connector framework is available for developers to customize existing self-managed connectors or build their own connectors.
Refer to <<es-connectors-framework>> for details.

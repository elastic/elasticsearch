=== 8.16.0 connectors release notes

[discrete]
[[es-connectors-release-notes-8-16-0-breaking]]
==== Breaking Changes

* Directly accessing connector and sync job state through `.elastic-connectors*` indices is deprecated, and will be disallowed entirely in a future release. Instead, the Elasticsearch Connector APIs should be used. Connectors framework code now uses the Elasticsearch Connector APIs by default.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2884[*PR 2902*]..

==== Enhancements

* *Docker namespaces*
+
Starting in `8.16.0`, two of our published Docker images and release artifacts now _also_ live under a new namespace: `integrations`, in addition to the existing `enterprise-search` namespace.
This concerns the https://github.com/elastic/connectors[Elastic Connectors] and the https://github.com/elastic/data-extraction-service[Elastic Data Extraction Service].
+
Please note that we recommend using the new `integrations` namespace, as we are consolidating integration Docker images there. We encourage users to adopt the new namespace as soon as possible.
+
** *Example*:
+
Old namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/enterprise-search/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`
+
New namespace::
`docker.elastic.co/integrations/elastic-connectors:v8.16.0`

* Docker images now use Chainguard's Wolfi base image (`docker.elastic.co/wolfi/jdk:openjdk-11-dev`), replacing the previous `ubuntu:focal` base.

* The Sharepoint Online connector now works with the `Sites.Selected` permission instead of the broader permission `Sites.Read.All`.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2762[*PR 2762*].

* Starting in 8.16.0, connectors will start using proper SEMVER, with `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, which aligns with Elasticsearch/Kibana versions. This drops the previous `.BUILD` suffix, which we used to release connectors between Elastic stack releases. Going forward, these inter-stack-release releases will be suffixed instead with `+<timestamp>`, aligning with Elastic Agent and conforming to SEMVER. 
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2749[*PR 2749*].

* Connector logs now use UTC timestamps, instead of machine-local timestamps. This only impacts logging output.
See https://github.com/elastic/connectors/pull/2695[*PR 2695*].

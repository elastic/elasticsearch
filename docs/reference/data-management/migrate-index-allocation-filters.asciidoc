== Migrate index allocation filters to node roles

If you currently use custom node attributes and
<<shard-allocation-filtering, attribute-based allocation filters>> to
move indices through <<data-tiers, data tiers>> in a
https://www.elastic.co/blog/implementing-hot-warm-cold-in-elasticsearch-with-index-lifecycle-management[hot-warm-cold architecture],
we recommend that you switch to using the built-in node roles
and automatic <<data-tier-allocation, data tier allocation>>.
Using node roles enables {ilm-init} to automatically
move indices between data tiers.

NOTE: While we recommend relying on automatic data tier allocation to manage
your data in a hot-warm-cold architecture,
you can still use attribute-based allocation filters to
control shard allocation for other purposes.

{ess} and {ece} can perform the migration automatically. For self-managed
deployments, you need to manually update your configuration, ILM policies, and
indices to switch to node roles.

[[cloud-migrate-to-node-roles]]
=== Automatically migrate to node roles on {ess} or {ece}

If you are using node attributes on {ess} or {ece}, you will be
prompted to switch to node roles when you:

* Upgrade to {es} 7.10 or higher
* Deploy a warm, cold, or frozen data tier
* {cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[Enable autoscaling]

These actions automatically update your cluster configuration
and {ilm-init} policies to use node roles. Additionally, upgrading to
version 7.14 or higher automatically update {ilm-init} policies
whenever any configuration change is applied to your deployment.


If you use custom index templates, check them after the automatic migration
completes and remove any <<shard-allocation-filtering, attribute-based
allocation filters>>.

NOTE: You do not need to take any further action after the automatic migration.
The following manual steps are only necessary if you do not allow the automatic
migration or have a self-managed deployment.

[[on-prem-migrate-to-node-roles]]
=== Migrate to node roles on self-managed deployments

To switch to using node roles:

. <<assign-data-tier, Assign data nodes>> to the appropriate data tier.
. <<remove-custom-allocation-settings, Remove the attribute-based allocation
settings>> from your {ilm} policy.
. <<stop-setting-custom-hot-attribute, Stop setting the custom hot attribute>>
on new indices.
. <<enforce-default-tier-preference, Enforce a default tier preference>>
on new indices.
. Update existing indices to <<set-tier-preference, set a tier preference>>.


[discrete]
[[assign-data-tier]]
==== Assign data nodes to a data tier

Configure the appropriate roles for each data node to assign it to one or more
data tiers: `data_hot`, `data_content`, `data_warm`, `data_cold`, or `data_frozen`.
A node can also have other <<modules-node,roles>>. By default, new nodes are
configured with all roles.

When you add a data tier to an {ess} deployment,
one or more nodes are automatically configured with the corresponding role.
To explicitly change the role of a node in an {ess} deployment, use the
{cloud}/ec-api-deployment-crud.html#ec_update_a_deployment[Update deployment API].
Replace the node's `node_type` configuration with the appropriate `node_roles`.
For example, the following configuration adds the node to the hot and content
tiers, and enables it to act as an ingest node, remote, and transform node.

[source,yaml]
----
"node_roles": [
  "data_hot",
  "data_content",
  "ingest",
  "remote_cluster_client",
  "transform"
],
----

If you are directly managing your own cluster,
configure the appropriate roles for each node in `elasticsearch.yml`.
For example, the following setting configures a node to be a data-only
node in the hot and content tiers.

[source,yaml]
----
node.roles [ data_hot, data_content ]
----

[discrete]
[[remove-custom-allocation-settings]]
==== Remove custom allocation settings from existing {ilm-init} policies

Update the allocate action for each lifecycle phase to remove the attribute-based
allocation settings. This enables {ilm-init} to inject the
<<ilm-migrate,migrate>> action into each phase
to automatically transition the indices through the data tiers.

If the allocate action does not set the number of replicas,
remove the allocate action entirely. (An empty allocate action is invalid.)

IMPORTANT: The policy must specify the corresponding phase for each data tier in
your architecture. Each phase must be present so {ilm-init} can inject the
migrate action to move indices through the data tiers.
If you don't need to perform any other actions, the phase can be empty.
For example, if you enable the warm and cold data tiers for a deployment,
your policy must include the hot, warm, and cold phases.

[discrete]
[[stop-setting-custom-hot-attribute]]
==== Stop setting the custom hot attribute on new indices

When you create a data stream, its first backing index
is now automatically assigned to `data_hot` nodes.
Similarly, when you directly create an index, it
is automatically assigned to `data_content` nodes.

On {ess} deployments, remove the `cloud-hot-warm-allocation-0` index template
that set the hot shard allocation attribute on all indices.

[source,console]
----
DELETE _template/.cloud-hot-warm-allocation-0
----
// TEST[skip:no cloud template]

If you're using a custom index template, update it to remove the <<shard-allocation-filtering, attribute-based allocation filters>> you used to assign new indices to the hot tier.

To completely avoid the issues that raise when mixing the tier preference and
custom attribute routing setting we also recommend updating all the legacy,
composable, and component templates to remove the <<shard-allocation-filtering, attribute-based allocation filters>>
from the settings they configure.

[discrete]
[[enforce-default-tier-preference]]
==== Enforce a default tier preference on new indices

Setting <<enforcing-a-default-tier-preference,`cluster.routing.allocation.enforce_default_tier_preference`>> to `true`
ensures that newly created indices will have a <<tier-preference-allocation-filter,_tier_preference>>, overriding the
<<indices-create-index,create index>> API or an associated <<index-templates,index template>>, if either of those
specifies `null` for the setting.

[source,console]
----
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enforce_default_tier_preference": true
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

[discrete]
[[set-tier-preference]]
==== Set a tier preference for existing indices

{ilm-init} automatically transitions managed indices through the available
data tiers by automatically injecting a <<ilm-migrate,migrate action>>
into each phase.

To enable {ilm-init} to move an _existing_ managed index
through the data tiers, update the index settings to:

. Remove the custom allocation filter by setting it to `null`.
. Set the <<tier-preference-allocation-filter,tier preference>>.

For example, if your old template set the `data` attribute to `hot`
to allocate shards to the hot tier, set the `data` attribute to `null`
and set the `_tier_preference` to `data_hot`.

////
[source,console]
----
PUT /my-index

PUT /my-index/_settings
{
  "index.routing.allocation.require.data": "hot"
}
----
////

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index/_settings
{
  "index.routing.allocation.require.data": null,
  "index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference": "data_hot"
}
----
// TEST[continued]

For indices that have already transitioned out of the hot phase,
the tier preference should include the appropriate fallback tiers
to ensure index shards can be allocated if the preferred tier
is unavailable.
For example, specify the hot tier as the fallback for indices
already in the warm phase.

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index/_settings
{
  "index.routing.allocation.require.data": null,
  "index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference": "data_warm,data_hot"
}
----
// TEST[continued]

If an index is already in the cold phase, include the cold, warm, and hot tiers.

For indices that have both the `_tier_preference` and `require.data` configured
but the `_tier_preference` is outdated (ie. the node attribute configuration
is "colder" than the configured `_tier_preference`), the migration needs to
remove the `require.data` attribute and update the `_tier_preference` to reflect
the correct tiering.

eg. For an index with the following routing configuration:
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "index.routing.allocation.require.data": "warm",
  "index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference": "data_hot"
}
----

The routing configuration should be fixed like so:
[source,console]
----
PUT my-index/_settings
{
  "index.routing.allocation.require.data": null,
  "index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference": "data_warm,data_hot"
}
----
// TEST[continued]

This situation can occur in a system that defaults to data tiers when, e.g.,
an ILM policy that uses node attributes is restored and transitions the managed
indices from the hot phase into the warm phase. In this case the node attribute
configuration indicates the correct tier where the index should be allocated.

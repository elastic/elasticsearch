=== Downsampling a time series data stream

Downsampling provides a method to reduce the footprint of your <<tsds,time
series data>> by storing it at reduced granularity.

Metrics solutions collect large amounts of time series data that grow over time.
As that data ages, it becomes less relevant to the current state of the system.
The downsampling process rolls up documents within a fixed time interval into a
single summary document. Each summary document includes statistical
representations of the original data: the `min`, `max`, `sum`, `value_count`,
and `average` for each metric. Data stream <<time-series-dimension,time series
dimensions>> are stored unchanged.

Downsampling, in effect, lets you to trade data resolution and precision for
storage size. You can include it in an <<index-lifecycle-management,{ilm}
({ilm-init})>> policy to automatically manage the volume and associated cost of
your metrics data at it ages.

[[how-downsampling-works]]
=== How it works

A <<time-series,time series>> is a sequence of observations taken over time for
a specific entity. The observed samples can be represented as a continuous
function, where the time series dimensions remain constant and the time series
metrics change over time.

//.Sampling a continuous function

In an Elasticsearch index, a single document is created for each timestamp,
containing the immutable time series dimensions, together with the metrics names
and the changing metrics values. For a single timestamp, several time series
dimensions and metrics may be stored.

For your most current and relevant data, the metrics series typically has a low
sampling time interval, so it's optimized for queries that require a high data
resolution.

Downsampling works on older, less frequently accessed data by replacing the
original time series with both a data stream of a higher sampling interval and
statistical representations of that data. Where the original metrics samples may
have been taken, for example, every ten seconds, as the data ages you may choose
to reduce the sample granularity to hourly or daily. You may choose to reduce
the granularity of `cold` archival data to monthly or less.

[[running-downsampling]]
=== Running downsampling on time series data

To downsample a time series index, use the
<<indices-downsample-data-stream,Downsample API>> and set `fixed_interval` to
the level of granularity that you'd like:

include::../indices/downsample-data-stream.asciidoc[tag=downsample-example]

To downsample time series data as part of ILM, include a
<<ilm-downsample,Downsample action>> in your ILM policy and set `fixed_interval`
to the level of granularity that you'd like:

[source,console]
----
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "downsample" : {
            "fixed_interval": "1h"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

[[querying-downsampled-indices]]
=== Querying downsampled indices

You can use the <<search-search,`_search`>> and <<async-search,`_async_search`>>
endpoints to query a downsampled index. Multiple raw data and downsampled
indices can be queried in a single request, and a single request can include
downsampled indices at different granularities (different bucket timespan). That
is, you can query data streams that contain downsampled indices with multiple
downsampling intervals (for example, `15m`, `1h`, `1d`).

The result of a time based histogram aggregation is in a uniform bucket size and
each downsampled index returns data ignoring the downsampling time interval. For
example, if you run a `date_histogram` aggregation with `"fixed_interval": "1m"`
on a downsampled index that has been downsampled at an hourly resolution
(`"fixed_interval": "1h"`), the query returns one bucket with all of the data at
minute 0, then 59 empty buckets, and then a bucket with data again for the next
hour.

[[querying-downsampled-indices-notes]]
==== Notes on downsample queries

There are a few things to note about querying downsampled indices:

* When you run queries in {kib} and through Elastic solutions, a normal
response is returned without notification that some of the queried indices are
downsampled.
* For
<<search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation,date histogram aggregations>>,
only `fixed_intervals` (and not calendar-aware intervals) are supported.
* Only Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) date-times are supported.

[[downsampling-restrictions]]
=== Restrictions and limitations

The following restrictions and limitations apply for downsampling:

* Only indices in a <<tsds,time series data stream>> are supported.

* Data is downsampled based on the time dimension only. All other dimensions are
copied to the new index without any modification.

* Within a data stream, a downsampled index replaces the original index and the
original index is deleted. Only one index can exist for a given time period.

* A source index must be in read-only mode for the downsampling process to
succeed. Check the <<downsampling-manual,Run downsampling manually>> example for
details.

* Downsampling data for the same period many times (downsampling of a
downsampled index) is supported. The downsampling interval must be a multiple of
the interval of the downsampled index.

* Downsampling is provided as an ILM action. See <<ilm-downsample,Downsample>>.

* The new, downsampled index is created on the data tier of the original index
and it inherits its settings (for example, the number of shards and replicas).

* The numeric `gauge` and `counter` <<mapping-field-meta,metric types>> are
supported.

* The downsampling configuration is extracted from the time series data stream
<<tsds-create-mappings-component-template,index mapping>>. The only additional
required setting is the downsampling `fixed_interval`.

=== Try it out

To take downsampling for a test run, try our example of
<<downsampling-manual,running downsampling manually>>.

Downsampling can easily be added to your ILM policy. To learn how, try our
<<downsampling-ilm,Run downsampling with ILM>> example.

Gets stats about the execution of the data stream lifecycle. The data stream level stats include only stats about data streams
managed by the data stream lifecycle.

`last_run_duration_in_millis`::
(Optional, long)
The duration of the last data stream lifecycle execution.
`time_between_starts_in_millis`::
(Optional, long)
The time passed between the start of the last two data stream lifecycle executions. This should amount approximately to
<<data-streams-lifecycle-poll-interval,`data_streams.lifecycle.poll_interval`>>.
`data_stream_count`::
(integer)
The count of data streams currently being managed by the data stream lifecycle.
`data_streams`::
(array of objects)
Contains information about the retrieved data stream lifecycles.

====
`name`::
(string)
The name of the data stream.
`backing_indices_in_total`::
(integer)
The count of the backing indices of this data stream that are managed by the data stream lifecycle.
`backing_indices_in_error`::
(integer)
The count of the backing indices of this data stream that are managed by the data stream lifecycle and have encountered an error.

Let's retrieve the data stream lifecycle stats of a cluster that has already executed the lifecycle more than once:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _lifecycle/stats?human&pretty
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:this is for demonstration purposes only, we cannot ensure that DSL has run]

The response will look like the following:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "last_run_duration_in_millis": 2,
  "last_run_duration": "2ms",
  "time_between_starts_in_millis": 9998,
  "time_between_starts": "9.99s",
  "data_streams_count": 2,
  "data_streams": [
    {
      "name": "my-data-stream",
      "backing_indices_in_total": 2,
      "backing_indices_in_error": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "my-other-stream",
      "backing_indices_in_total": 2,
      "backing_indices_in_error": 1
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

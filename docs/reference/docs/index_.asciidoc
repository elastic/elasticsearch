[[docs-index_]]
== Index API

The index API adds or updates a typed JSON document in a specific index,
making it searchable. The following example inserts the JSON document
into the "twitter" index, under a type called "tweet" with an id of 1:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

The result of the above index operation is:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "_shards" : {
        "total" : 10,
        "failed" : 0,
        "successful" : 10
    },
    "_index" : "twitter",
    "_type" : "tweet",
    "_id" : "1",
    "_version" : 1,
    "created" : true
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `_shards` header provides information about the replication process of the index operation.
* `total` - Indicates to how many shard copies (primary and replica shards) the index operation should be executed on.
* `successful`- Indicates the number of shard copies the index operation succeeded on.
* `failures` - An array that contains replication related errors in the case an index operation failed on a replica shard.

The index operation is successful in the case `successful` is at least 1.

NOTE:   Replica shards may not all be started when an indexing operation successfully returns (by default, a  quorum is
        required). In that case, `total` will be equal to the total shards based on the index replica settings and
        `successful` will be equal to the number of shard started (primary plus replicas). As there were no failures,
        the `failed` will be 0.

[float]
[[index-creation]]
=== Automatic Index Creation

The index operation automatically creates an index if it has not been
created before (check out the
<<indices-create-index,create index API>> for manually
creating an index), and also automatically creates a
dynamic type mapping for the specific type if one has not yet been
created (check out the <<indices-put-mapping,put mapping>>
API for manually creating a type mapping).

The mapping itself is very flexible and is schema-free. New fields and
objects will automatically be added to the mapping definition of the
type specified. Check out the <<mapping,mapping>>
section for more information on mapping definitions.

Automatic index creation can be disabled by setting
`action.auto_create_index` to `false` in the config file of all nodes.
Automatic mapping creation can be disabled by setting
`index.mapper.dynamic` to `false` in the config files of all nodes (or
on the specific index settings).

Automatic index creation can include a pattern based white/black list,
for example, set `action.auto_create_index` to `+aaa*,-bbb*,+ccc*,-*` (+
meaning allowed, and - meaning disallowed).

[float]
[[index-versioning]]
=== Versioning

Each indexed document is given a version number. The associated
`version` number is returned as part of the response to the index API
request. The index API optionally allows for
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control[optimistic
concurrency control] when the `version` parameter is specified. This
will control the version of the document the operation is intended to be
executed against. A good example of a use case for versioning is
performing a transactional read-then-update. Specifying a `version` from
the document initially read ensures no changes have happened in the
meantime (when reading in order to update, it is recommended to set
`preference` to `_primary`). For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?version=2' -d '{
    "message" : "elasticsearch now has versioning support, double cool!"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

*NOTE:* versioning is completely real time, and is not affected by the
near real time aspects of search operations. If no version is provided,
then the operation is executed without any version checks.

By default, internal versioning is used that starts at 1 and increments
with each update, deletes included. Optionally, the version number can be
supplemented with an external value (for example, if maintained in a
database). To enable this functionality, `version_type` should be set to
`external`. The value provided must be a numeric, long value greater or equal to 0,
and less than around 9.2e+18. When using the external version type, instead
of checking for a matching version number, the system checks to see if
the version number passed to the index request is greater than the
version of the currently stored document. If true, the document will be
indexed and the new version number used. If the value provided is less
than or equal to the stored document's version number, a version
conflict will occur and the index operation will fail.

A nice side effect is that there is no need to maintain strict ordering
of async indexing operations executed as a result of changes to a source
database, as long as version numbers from the source database are used.
Even the simple case of updating the elasticsearch index using data from
a database is simplified if external versioning is used, as only the
latest version will be used if the index operations are out of order for
whatever reason.

[float]
==== Version types

Next to the `internal` & `external` version types explained above, Elasticsearch
also supports other types for specific use cases. Here is an overview of
the different version types and their semantics.

`internal`:: only index the document if the given version is identical to the version
of the stored document.

`external` or `external_gt`:: only index the document if the given version is strictly higher
than the version of the stored document *or* if there is no existing document. The given
version will be used as the new version and will be stored with the new document. The supplied
version must be a non-negative long number.

`external_gte`:: only index the document if the given version is *equal* or higher
than the version of the stored document. If there is no existing document
the operation will succeed as well. The given version will be used as the new version
and will be stored with the new document. The supplied version must be a non-negative long number.

`force`:: the document will be indexed regardless of the version of the stored document or if there
is no existing document. The given version will be used as the new version and will be stored
with the new document. This version type is typically used for correcting errors.

*NOTE*: The `external_gte` & `force` version types are meant for special use cases and should be used
with care. If used incorrectly, they can result in loss of data.

[float]
[[operation-type]]
=== Operation Type

The index operation also accepts an `op_type` that can be used to force
a `create` operation, allowing for "put-if-absent" behavior. When
`create` is used, the index operation will fail if a document by that id
already exists in the index.

Here is an example of using the `op_type` parameter:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?op_type=create' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

Another option to specify `create` is to use the following uri:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_create' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

[float]
=== Automatic ID Generation

The index operation can be executed without specifying the id. In such a
case, an id will be generated automatically. In addition, the `op_type`
will automatically be set to `create`. Here is an example (note the
*POST* used instead of *PUT*):

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

The result of the above index operation is:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "_index" : "twitter",
    "_type" : "tweet",
    "_id" : "6a8ca01c-7896-48e9-81cc-9f70661fcb32",
    "_version" : 1,
    "created" : true
}
--------------------------------------------------

[float]
[[index-routing]]
=== Routing

By default, shard placement — or `routing` — is controlled by using a
hash of the document's id value. For more explicit control, the value
fed into the hash function used by the router can be directly specified
on a per-operation basis using the `routing` parameter. For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet?routing=kimchy' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

In the example above, the "tweet" document is routed to a shard based on
the `routing` parameter provided: "kimchy".

When setting up explicit mapping, the `_routing` field can be optionally
used to direct the index operation to extract the routing value from the
document itself. This does come at the (very minimal) cost of an
additional document parsing pass. If the `_routing` mapping is defined,
and set to be `required`, the index operation will fail if no routing
value is provided or extracted.

[float]
[[parent-children]]
=== Parents & Children

A child document can be indexed by specifying its parent when indexing.
For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT localhost:9200/blogs/blog_tag/1122?parent=1111 -d '{
    "tag" : "something"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

When indexing a child document, the routing value is automatically set
to be the same as its parent, unless the routing value is explicitly
specified using the `routing` parameter.

[float]
[[index-timestamp]]
=== Timestamp

deprecated[2.0.0,The `_timestamp` field is deprecated.  Instead, use a normal <<date,`date`>> field and set its value explicitly]

A document can be indexed with a `timestamp` associated with it. The
`timestamp` value of a document can be set using the `timestamp`
parameter. For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?timestamp=2009-11-15T14%3A12%3A12 -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

If the `timestamp` value is not provided externally or in the `_source`,
the `timestamp` will be automatically set to the date the document was
processed by the indexing chain. More information can be found on the
<<mapping-timestamp-field,_timestamp mapping
page>>.

[float]
[[index-ttl]]
=== TTL

deprecated[2.0.0,The current `_ttl` implementation is deprecated and will be replaced with a different implementation in a future version]


A document can be indexed with a `ttl` (time to live) associated with
it. Expired documents will be expunged automatically. The expiration
date that will be set for a document with a provided `ttl` is relative
to the `timestamp` of the document, meaning it can be based on the time
of indexing or on any time provided. The provided `ttl` must be strictly
positive and can be a number (in milliseconds) or any valid time value
as shown in the following examples:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?ttl=86400000' -d '{
    "user": "kimchy",
    "message": "Trying out elasticsearch, so far so good?"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?ttl=1d' -d '{
    "user": "kimchy",
    "message": "Trying out elasticsearch, so far so good?"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{
    "_ttl": "1d",
    "user": "kimchy",
    "message": "Trying out elasticsearch, so far so good?"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

More information can be found on the
<<mapping-ttl-field,_ttl mapping page>>.

[float]
[[index-distributed]]
=== Distributed

The index operation is directed to the primary shard based on its route
(see the Routing section above) and performed on the actual node
containing this shard. After the primary shard completes the operation,
if needed, the update is distributed to applicable replicas.

[float]
[[index-consistency]]
=== Write Consistency

To prevent writes from taking place on the "wrong" side of a network
partition, by default, index operations only succeed if a quorum
(>replicas/2+1) of active shards are available. This default can be
overridden on a node-by-node basis using the `action.write_consistency`
setting. To alter this behavior per-operation, the `consistency` request
parameter can be used.

Valid write consistency values are `one`, `quorum`, and `all`.

Note, for the case where the number of replicas is 1 (total of 2 copies
of the data), then the default behavior is to succeed if 1 copy (the primary)
can perform the write.

The index operation only returns after all *active* shards within the
replication group have indexed the document (sync replication).

[float]
[[index-refresh]]
=== Refresh

To refresh the shard (not the whole index) immediately after the operation
occurs, so that the document appears in search results immediately, the
`refresh` parameter can be set to `true`. Setting this option to `true` should
*ONLY* be done after careful thought and verification that it does not lead to
poor performance, both from an indexing and a search standpoint. Note, getting
a document using the get API is completely realtime and doesn't require a
refresh.

[float]
[[index-noop]]
=== Noop Updates

When updating a document using the index api a new version of the document is
always created even if the document hasn't changed. If this isn't acceptable
use the `_update` api with `detect_noop` set to true. This option isn't
available on the index api because the index api doesn't fetch the old source
and isn't able to compare it against the new source.

There isn't a hard and fast rule about when noop updates aren't acceptable.
It's a combination of lots of factors like how frequently your data source
sends updates that are actually noops and how many queries per second
elasticsearch runs on the shard with receiving the updates.

[float]
[[timeout]]
=== Timeout

The primary shard assigned to perform the index operation might not be
available when the index operation is executed. Some reasons for this
might be that the primary shard is currently recovering from a gateway
or undergoing relocation. By default, the index operation will wait on
the primary shard to become available for up to 1 minute before failing
and responding with an error. The `timeout` parameter can be used to
explicitly specify how long it waits. Here is an example of setting it
to 5 minutes:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1?timeout=5m' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
--------------------------------------------------

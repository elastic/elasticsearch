[[docs-reindex]]
== Reindex API

experimental[The reindex API is new and should still be considered experimental.  The API may change in ways that are not backwards compatible]

The most basic form of `_reindex` just copies documents from one index to another.
This will copy documents from the `twitter` index into the `new_twitter` index:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:big_twitter]

That will return something like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "took" : 147,
  "timed_out": false,
  "created": 120,
  "updated": 0,
  "deleted": 0,
  "batches": 1,
  "version_conflicts": 0,
  "noops": 0,
  "retries": {
    "bulk": 0,
    "search": 0
  },
  "throttled_millis": 0,
  "requests_per_second": "unlimited",
  "throttled_until_millis": 0,
  "total": 120,
  "failures" : [ ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"took" : 147/"took" : "$body.took"/]

Just like <<docs-update-by-query,`_update_by_query`>>, `_reindex` gets a
snapshot of the source index but its target must be a **different** index so
version conflicts are unlikely. The `dest` element can be configured like the
index API to control optimistic concurrency control. Just leaving out
`version_type` (as above) or setting it to `internal` will cause Elasticsearch
to blindly dump documents into the target, overwriting any that happen to have
the same type and id:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter",
    "version_type": "internal"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

Setting `version_type` to `external` will cause Elasticsearch to preserve the
`version` from the source, create any documents that are missing, and update
any documents that have an older version in the destination index than they do
in the source index:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter",
    "version_type": "external"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

Settings `op_type` to `create` will cause `_reindex` to only create missing
documents in the target index. All existing documents will cause a version
conflict:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter",
    "op_type": "create"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

By default version conflicts abort the `_reindex` process but you can just
count them by settings `"conflicts": "proceed"` in the request body:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "conflicts": "proceed",
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter",
    "op_type": "create"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

You can limit the documents by adding a type to the `source` or by adding a
query. This will only copy ++tweet++&apos;s made by `kimchy` into `new_twitter`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter",
    "type": "tweet",
    "query": {
      "term": {
        "user": "kimchy"
      }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

`index` and `type` in `source` can both be lists, allowing you to copy from
lots of sources in one request. This will copy documents from the `tweet` and
`post` types in the `twitter` and `blog` index. It'd include the `post` type in
the `twitter` index and the `tweet` type in the `blog` index. If you want to be
more specific you'll need to use the `query`. It also makes no effort to handle
ID collisions. The target index will remain valid but it's not easy to predict
which document will survive because the iteration order isn't well defined.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": ["twitter", "blog"],
    "type": ["tweet", "post"]
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "all_together"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[s/^/PUT twitter\nPUT blog\nGET _cluster\/health?wait_for_status=yellow\n/]

It's also possible to limit the number of processed documents by setting
`size`. This will only copy a single document from `twitter` to
`new_twitter`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "size": 1,
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

If you want a particular set of documents from the twitter index you'll
need to sort. Sorting makes the scroll less efficient but in some contexts
it's worth it. If possible, prefer a more selective query to `size` and `sort`.
This will copy 10000 documents from `twitter` into `new_twitter`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "size": 10000,
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter",
    "sort": { "date": "desc" }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

Like `_update_by_query`, `_reindex` supports a script that modifies the
document. Unlike `_update_by_query`, the script is allowed to modify the
document's metadata. This example bumps the version of the source document:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter",
    "version_type": "external"
  },
  "script": {
    "inline": "if (ctx._source.foo == 'bar') {ctx._version++; ctx._source.remove('foo')}"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

Just as in `_update_by_query`, you can set `ctx.op` to change the
operation that is executed on the destination index:

`noop`::

Set `ctx.op = "noop"` if your script decides that the document doesn't have
to be indexed in the destination index. This no operation will be reported
in the `noop` counter in the <<docs-reindex-response-body, response body>>.

`delete`::

Set `ctx.op = "delete"` if your script decides that the document must be
 deleted from the destination index. The deletion will be reported in the
 `deleted` counter in the <<docs-reindex-response-body, response body>>.

Setting `ctx.op` to anything else is an error. Setting any
other field in `ctx` is an error.

Think of the possibilities! Just be careful! With great power.... You can
change:

 * `_id`
 * `_type`
 * `_index`
 * `_version`
 * `_routing`
 * `_parent`
 * `_timestamp`
 * `_ttl`

Setting `_version` to `null` or clearing it from the `ctx` map is just like not
sending the version in an indexing request. It will cause that document to be
overwritten in the target index regardless of the version on the target or the
version type you use in the `_reindex` request.

By default if `_reindex` sees a document with routing then the routing is
preserved unless it's changed by the script. You can set `routing` on the
`dest` request to change this:

`keep`::

Sets the routing on the bulk request sent for each match to the routing on
the match. The default.

`discard`::

Sets the routing on the bulk request sent for each match to null.

`=<some text>`::

Sets the routing on the bulk request sent for each match to all text after
the `=`.

For example, you can use the following request to copy all documents from
the `source` index with the company name `cat` into the `dest` index with
routing set to `cat`.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "source",
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "company": "cat"
      }
    }
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "dest",
    "routing": "=cat"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[s/^/PUT source\nGET _cluster\/health?wait_for_status=yellow\n/]

By default `_reindex` uses scroll batches of 1000. You can change the
batch size with the `size` field in the `source` element:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "source",
    "size": 100
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "dest",
    "routing": "=cat"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[s/^/PUT source\nGET _cluster\/health?wait_for_status=yellow\n/]

Reindex can also use the <<ingest>> feature by specifying a
`pipeline` like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "source"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "dest",
    "pipeline": "some_ingest_pipeline"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[s/^/PUT source\nGET _cluster\/health?wait_for_status=yellow\n/]

=== URL Parameters

In addition to the standard parameters like `pretty`, the Reindex API also
supports `refresh`, `wait_for_completion`, `consistency`, `timeout`, and
`requests_per_second`.

Sending the `refresh` url parameter will cause all indexes to which the request
wrote to be refreshed. This is different than the Index API's `refresh`
parameter which causes just the shard that received the new data to be indexed.

If the request contains `wait_for_completion=false` then Elasticsearch will
perform some preflight checks, launch the request, and then return a `task`
which can be used with <<docs-reindex-task-api,Tasks APIs>>
to cancel or get the status of the task. Elasticsearch will also create a
record of this task as a document at `.tasks/task/${taskId}`. This is yours
to keep or remove as you see fit. When you are done with it, delete it so
Elasticsearch can reclaim the space it uses.

`consistency` controls how many copies of a shard must respond to each write
request. `timeout` controls how long each write request waits for unavailable
shards to become available. Both work exactly how they work in the
<<docs-bulk,Bulk API>>.

`requests_per_second` can be set to any decimal number (`1.4`, `6`, `1000`, etc)
and throttles the number of requests per second that the reindex issues. The
throttling is done waiting between bulk batches so that it can manipulate the
scroll timeout. The wait time is the difference between the time it took the
batch to complete and the time `requests_per_second * requests_in_the_batch`.
Since the batch isn't broken into multiple bulk requests large batch sizes will
cause Elasticsearch to create many requests and then wait for a while before
starting the next set. This is "bursty" instead of "smooth". The default is
`unlimited` which is also the only non-number value that it accepts.

[float]
[[docs-reindex-response-body]]
=== Response body

The JSON response looks like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "took" : 639,
  "updated": 0,
  "created": 123,
  "batches": 1,
  "version_conflicts": 2,
  "retries": {
    "bulk": 0,
    "search": 0
  }
  "throttled_millis": 0,
  "failures" : [ ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

`took`::

The number of milliseconds from start to end of the whole operation.

`updated`::

The number of documents that were successfully updated.

`created`::

The number of documents that were successfully created.

`batches`::

The number of scroll responses pulled back by the the reindex.

`version_conflicts`::

The number of version conflicts that reindex hit.

`retries`::

The number of retries attempted by reindex. `bulk` is the number of bulk
actions retried and `search` is the number of search actions retried.

`throttled_millis`::

Number of milliseconds the request slept to conform to `requests_per_second`.

`failures`::

Array of all indexing failures. If this is non-empty then the request aborted
because of those failures. See `conflicts` for how to prevent version conflicts
from aborting the operation.

[float]
[[docs-reindex-task-api]]
=== Works with the Task API

You can fetch the status of all running reindex requests with the
<<tasks,Task API>>:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _tasks?detailed=true&actions=*reindex
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The responses looks like:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "nodes" : {
    "r1A2WoRbTwKZ516z6NEs5A" : {
      "name" : "Tyrannus",
      "transport_address" : "127.0.0.1:9300",
      "host" : "127.0.0.1",
      "ip" : "127.0.0.1:9300",
      "attributes" : {
        "testattr" : "test",
        "portsfile" : "true"
      },
      "tasks" : {
        "r1A2WoRbTwKZ516z6NEs5A:36619" : {
          "node" : "r1A2WoRbTwKZ516z6NEs5A",
          "id" : 36619,
          "type" : "transport",
          "action" : "indices:data/write/reindex",
          "status" : {    <1>
            "total" : 6154,
            "updated" : 3500,
            "created" : 0,
            "deleted" : 0,
            "batches" : 4,
            "version_conflicts" : 0,
            "noops" : 0,
            "retries": {
              "bulk": 0,
              "search": 0
            },
            "throttled_millis": 0
          },
          "description" : ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> this object contains the actual status. It is just like the response json
with the important addition of the `total` field. `total` is the total number
of operations that the reindex expects to perform. You can estimate the
progress by adding the `updated`, `created`, and `deleted` fields. The request
will finish when their sum is equal to the `total` field.

With the task id you can look up the task directly:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_tasks/taskId:1
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[catch:missing]

The advantage of this API is that it integrates with `wait_for_completion=false`
to transparently return the status of completed tasks. If the task is completed
and `wait_for_completion=false` was set on it them it'll come back with a
`results` or an `error` field. The cost of this feature is the document that
`wait_for_completion=false` creates at `.tasks/task/${taskId}`. It is up to
you to delete that document.


[float]
[[docs-reindex-cancel-task-api]]
=== Works with the Cancel Task API

Any Reindex can be canceled using the <<tasks,Task Cancel API>>:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _tasks/taskid:1/_cancel
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The `task_id` can be found using the tasks API above.

Cancelation should happen quickly but might take a few seconds. The task status
API above will continue to list the task until it is wakes to cancel itself.


[float]
[[docs-reindex-rethrottle]]
=== Rethrottling

The value of `requests_per_second` can be changed on a running reindex using
the `_rethrottle` API:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex/taskid:1/_rethrottle?requests_per_second=unlimited
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The `task_id` can be found using the tasks API above.

Just like when setting it on the `_reindex` API `requests_per_second` can be
either `unlimited` to disable throttling or any decimal number like `1.7` or
`12` to throttle to that level. Rethrottling that speeds up the query takes
effect immediately but rethrotting that slows down the query will take effect
on after completing the current batch. This prevents scroll timeouts.


[float]
=== Reindex to change the name of a field

`_reindex` can be used to build a copy of an index with renamed fields. Say you
create an index containing documents that look like this:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST test/test/1?refresh
{
  "text": "words words",
  "flag": "foo"
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

But you don't like the name `flag` and want to replace it with `tag`.
`_reindex` can create the other index for you:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "test"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "test2"
  },
  "script": {
    "inline": "ctx._source.tag = ctx._source.remove(\"flag\")"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[continued]

Now you can get the new document:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET test2/test/1
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[continued]

and it'll look like:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "found": true,
  "_id": "1",
  "_index": "test2",
  "_type": "test",
  "_version": 1,
  "_source": {
    "text": "words words",
    "tag": "foo"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE

Or you can search by `tag` or whatever you want.

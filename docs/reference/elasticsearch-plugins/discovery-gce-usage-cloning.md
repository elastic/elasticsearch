# Cloning your existing machine [discovery-gce-usage-cloning]

In order to build a cluster on many nodes, you can clone your configured instance to new nodes. You wonâ€™t have to reinstall everything!

First create an image of your running instance and upload it to Google Cloud Storage:

```sh
# Create an image of your current instance
sudo /usr/bin/gcimagebundle -d /dev/sda -o /tmp/

# An image has been created in `/tmp` directory:
ls /tmp
e4686d7f5bf904a924ae0cfeb58d0827c6d5b966.image.tar.gz

# Upload your image to Google Cloud Storage:
# Create a bucket to hold your image, let's say `esimage`:
gsutil mb gs://esimage

# Copy your image to this bucket:
gsutil cp /tmp/e4686d7f5bf904a924ae0cfeb58d0827c6d5b966.image.tar.gz gs://esimage

# Then add your image to images collection:
gcloud compute images create elasticsearch-2-0-0 --source-uri gs://esimage/e4686d7f5bf904a924ae0cfeb58d0827c6d5b966.image.tar.gz

# If the previous command did not work for you, logout from your instance
# and launch the same command from your local machine.
```

## Start new instances [discovery-gce-usage-start-new-instances]

As you have now an image, you can create as many instances as you need:

```sh
# Just change node name (here myesnode2)
gcloud compute instances create myesnode2 --image elasticsearch-2-0-0 --zone europe-west1-a

# If you want to provide all details directly, you can use:
gcloud compute instances create myesnode2 --image=elasticsearch-2-0-0 \
       --zone europe-west1-a --machine-type f1-micro --scopes=compute-rw
```


## Remove an instance (aka shut it down) [discovery-gce-usage-remove-instance]

You can use [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/console) or CLI to manage your instances:

```sh
# Stopping and removing instances
gcloud compute instances delete myesnode1 myesnode2 \
       --zone=europe-west1-a

# Consider removing disk as well if you don't need them anymore
gcloud compute disks delete boot-myesnode1 boot-myesnode2  \
       --zone=europe-west1-a
```

# Command-line tools [commands]

:::{tip}
When running {{es}} in a self-managed environment, you can interact with or manage the cluster using command-line tools. These tools assume you have access to {{es}} nodes and therefore are not available in {{ece}}, {{ech}}, and {{eck}} deployments. The command-line tools are also not available in {{serverless-full}}.
:::

{{es}} provides the following tools for configuring security and performing other tasks from the command line:

# Index management settings [index-management-settings]

You can use the following cluster settings to enable or disable index management features.

$$$auto-create-index$$$

`action.auto_create_index` ![logo cloud](https://doc-icons.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/logo_cloud.svg "Supported on Elastic Cloud Hosted")
:   ([Dynamic](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)) [Automatically create an index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) if it doesnâ€™t already exist and apply any configured index templates. Defaults to `true`.

$$$action-destructive-requires-name$$$

`action.destructive_requires_name` ![logo cloud](https://doc-icons.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/logo_cloud.svg "Supported on Elastic Cloud Hosted")
:   ([Dynamic](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)) When set to `true`, you must specify the index name to [delete an index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-delete). It is not possible to delete all indices with `_all` or use wildcards. Defaults to `true`.

$$$cluster-indices-close-enable$$$

`cluster.indices.close.enable` ![logo cloud](https://doc-icons.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/logo_cloud.svg "Supported on Elastic Cloud Hosted")
:   ([Dynamic](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)) Enables [closing of open indices](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-close) in {{es}}. If `false`, you cannot close open indices. Defaults to `true` for versions 7.2.0 and later, and to `false` for previous versions. In versions 7.1 and below, closed indices represent a data loss risk: if you close an index, it is not included in snapshots and you will not be able to restore the data. Similarly, closed indices are not included when you make cluster configuration changes, such as scaling to a different capacity, failover, and many other operations. Lastly, closed indices can lead to inaccurate disk space counts.

    ::::{warning}
    For versions 7.1 and below, closed indices represent a data loss risk. Enable this setting only temporarily for these versions.
    ::::
    
    ::::{note}
    Closed indices still consume a significant amount of disk space.

$$$stack-templates-enabled$$$

`stack.templates.enabled`
:   ([Dynamic](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)) If `true`, enables built-in index and component templates. [{{agent}}](docs-content://reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/index.md) uses these templates to create data streams. If `false`, {{es}} disables these index and component templates. Defaults to `true`.

::::{note}
It is not recommended to disable the built-in stack templates, as some functionality of {{es}} or Kibana will not work correctly when disabled. Features like log and metric collection, as well as Kibana reporting, may malfunction without the built-in stack templates. Stack templates should only be disabled temporarily, if necessary, to resolve upgrade issues, then re-enabled after any issues have been resolved.

This setting affects the following built-in index templates:

* `.kibana-reporting*`
* `logs-*-*`
* `metrics-*-*`
* `synthetics-*-*`
* `profiling-*`
* `security_solution-*-*`

This setting also affects the following built-in component templates:

* `kibana-reporting@settings`
* `logs@mappings`
* `logs@settings`
* `metrics@mappings`
* `metrics@settings`
* `metrics@tsdb-settings`
* `synthetics@mapping`
* `synthetics@settings`

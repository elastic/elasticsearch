# {{watcher}} settings in Elasticsearch [notification-settings]


$$$notification-settings-description$$$
You configure {{watcher}} settings to set up {{watcher}} and send notifications via [email](#email-notification-settings), [Slack](#slack-notification-settings), and [PagerDuty](#pagerduty-notification-settings).

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {{es}} keystore. For more information about creating and updating the {{es}} keystore, see [Secure settings](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md). Dynamic settings can also be updated across a cluster with the [cluster update settings API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-put-settings).

## General Watcher Settings [general-notification-settings]

`xpack.watcher.enabled`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Set to `false` to disable {{watcher}} on the node.

$$$xpack-watcher-encrypt-sensitive-data$$$

`xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data` ![logo cloud](https://doc-icons.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/logo_cloud.svg "Supported on {{ess}}")
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Set to `true` to encrypt sensitive data. If this setting is enabled, you must also specify the `xpack.watcher.encryption_key` setting. For more information, see [*Encrypting sensitive data in {{watcher}}*](docs-content://explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher/encrypting-data.md).

`xpack.watcher.encryption_key`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) Specifies the path to a file that contains a key for encrypting sensitive data. If `xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data` is set to `true`, this setting is required. For more information, see [*Encrypting sensitive data in {{watcher}}*](docs-content://explore-analyze/alerts-cases/watcher/encrypting-data.md).

`xpack.watcher.max.history.record.size`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The maximum size watcher history record that can be written into the watcher history index. Any larger history record will have some of its larger fields removed. Defaults to 10mb.

`xpack.http.proxy.host`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Specifies the address of the proxy server to use to connect to HTTP services.

`xpack.http.proxy.port`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Specifies the port number to use to connect to the proxy server.

`xpack.http.proxy.scheme`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Protocol used to communicate with the proxy server. Valid values are `http` and `https`. Defaults to the protocol used in the request.

`xpack.http.default_connection_timeout`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The maximum period to wait until abortion of the request, when a connection is being initiated.

`xpack.http.default_read_timeout`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The maximum period of inactivity between two data packets, before the request is aborted.

`xpack.http.tcp.keep_alive`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Whether to enable TCP keepalives on HTTP connections. Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.http.connection_pool_ttl`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The time-to-live of connections in the connection pool. If a connection is not re-used within this timeout, it is closed. By default, the time-to-live is infinite meaning that connections never expire.

`xpack.http.max_response_size`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Specifies the maximum size an HTTP response is allowed to have, defaults to `10mb`, the maximum configurable value is `50mb`.

`xpack.http.whitelist`
:   ([Dynamic](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#dynamic-cluster-setting)) A list of URLs, that the internal HTTP client is allowed to connect to. This client is used in the HTTP input, the webhook, the slack, pagerduty, and jira actions. This setting can be updated dynamically. It defaults to `*` allowing everything. Note: If you configure this setting and you are using one of the slack/pagerduty actions, you have to ensure that the corresponding endpoints are explicitly allowed as well.


## {{watcher}} HTTP TLS/SSL settings [ssl-notification-settings]

You can configure the following TLS/SSL settings.

`xpack.http.ssl.supported_protocols`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols: `SSLv2Hello`, `SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`. If the JVM’s SSL provider supports TLSv1.3, the default is `TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1`. Otherwise, the default is `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1`.

    {{es}} relies on your JDK’s implementation of SSL and TLS. View [Supported SSL/TLS versions by JDK version](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/supported-ssltls-versions-by-jdk-version.md) for more information.

    ::::{note}
    If `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is `true`, you cannot use `SSLv2Hello` or `SSLv3`. See [FIPS 140-2](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/fips-140-2.md).
    ::::


`xpack.http.ssl.verification_mode`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Defines how to verify the certificates presented by another party in the TLS connection:

    ::::{dropdown} Valid values
    `full`
    :   Validates that the provided certificate: has an issue date that’s within the `not_before` and `not_after` dates; chains to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA); has a `hostname` or IP address that matches the names within the certificate.

    `certificate`
    :   Validates the provided certificate and verifies that it’s signed by a trusted authority (CA), but doesn’t check the certificate `hostname`.

    `none`
    :   Performs no certificate validation.

        ::::{important}
        Setting certificate validation to `none` disables many security benefits of SSL/TLS, which is very dangerous. Only set this value if instructed by Elastic Support as a temporary diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors.
        ::::


    ::::


    Defaults to `full`.


`xpack.http.ssl.cipher_suites`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Supported cipher suites vary depending on which version of Java you use. For example, for version 12 the default value is `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`.

### {{watcher}} HTTP TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings [watcher-tls-ssl-key-trusted-certificate-settings]

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS connection. A private key and certificate are optional and would be used if the server requires client authentication for PKI authentication.


### PEM encoded files [_pem_encoded_files_6]

When using PEM encoded files, use the following settings:

`xpack.http.ssl.key`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Path to a PEM encoded file containing the private key.

    If HTTP client authentication is required, it uses this file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.keystore.path` at the same time.


`xpack.http.ssl.secure_key_passphrase`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The passphrase that is used to decrypt the private key. Since the key might not be encrypted, this value is optional.

`xpack.http.ssl.certificate`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Specifies the path for the PEM encoded certificate (or certificate chain) that is associated with the key.

    This setting can be used only if `ssl.key` is set.


`xpack.http.ssl.certificate_authorities`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) List of paths to PEM encoded certificate files that should be trusted.

    This setting and `ssl.truststore.path` cannot be used at the same time.

:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore file that contains a private key and certificate.

    It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.key` at the same time.


`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The password for the keystore.

`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password`

`xpack.http.ssl.truststore.path`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore that contains the certificates to trust. It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file.

    You cannot use this setting and `ssl.certificate_authorities` at the same time.


`xpack.http.ssl.truststore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) Password for the truststore.


### PKCS#12 files [watcher-pkcs12-files]

{{es}} can be configured to use PKCS#12 container files (`.p12` or `.pfx` files) that contain the private key, certificate and certificates that should be trusted.

PKCS#12 files are configured in the same way as Java keystore files:

`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.path`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore file that contains a private key and certificate.

    It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.key` at the same time.


`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.type`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The format of the keystore file. It must be either `jks` or `PKCS12`. If the keystore path ends in ".p12", ".pfx", or ".pkcs12", this setting defaults to `PKCS12`. Otherwise, it defaults to `jks`.

`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The password for the keystore.

`xpack.http.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password`

    You cannot use this setting and `ssl.certificate_authorities` at the same time.


`xpack.http.ssl.truststore.type`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Set this to `PKCS12` to indicate that the truststore is a PKCS#12 file.

`xpack.http.ssl.truststore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) Password for the truststore.



## Email Notification Settings [email-notification-settings]

Emails with recipients (`To:`, `Cc:`, or `Bcc:`) outside of these patterns will be rejected and an error thrown. This setting defaults to `["*"]` which means all recipients are allowed. Simple globbing is supported, such as `list-*@company.com` in the list of allowed recipients.

::::{note}
This setting can’t be used at the same time as `xpack.notification.email.account.domain_allowlist` and an error will be thrown if both are set at the same time. This setting can be used to specify domains to allow by using a wildcard pattern such as `*@company.com`.
::::


`xpack.notification.email.account`
:   Specifies account information for sending notifications via email. You can specify the following email account attributes:

`xpack.notification.email.account.domain_allowlist`

### {{watcher}} Email TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings [watcher-email-tls-ssl-key-trusted-certificate-settings]

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS connection. A private key and certificate are optional and would be used if the server requires client authentication for PKI authentication.


### PEM encoded files [_pem_encoded_files_7]

When using PEM encoded files, use the following settings:

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.key`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Path to a PEM encoded file containing the private key.

    If HTTP client authentication is required, it uses this file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.keystore.path` at the same time.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.secure_key_passphrase`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The passphrase that is used to decrypt the private key. Since the key might not be encrypted, this value is optional.

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.certificate`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Specifies the path for the PEM encoded certificate (or certificate chain) that is associated with the key.

    This setting can be used only if `ssl.key` is set.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.certificate_authorities`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) List of paths to PEM encoded certificate files that should be trusted.

    This setting and `ssl.truststore.path` cannot be used at the same time.



### Java keystore files [_java_keystore_files_7]

:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore file that contains a private key and certificate.

    It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.key` at the same time.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The password for the keystore.

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password`

    You cannot use this setting and `ssl.certificate_authorities` at the same time.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.truststore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) Password for the truststore.


### PKCS#12 files [watcher-email-pkcs12-files]

{{es}} can be configured to use PKCS#12 container files (`.p12` or `.pfx` files) that contain the private key, certificate and certificates that should be trusted.

PKCS#12 files are configured in the same way as Java keystore files:

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.path`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore file that contains a private key and certificate.

    It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file. You cannot use this setting and `ssl.key` at the same time.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.type`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The format of the keystore file. It must be either `jks` or `PKCS12`. If the keystore path ends in ".p12", ".pfx", or ".pkcs12", this setting defaults to `PKCS12`. Otherwise, it defaults to `jks`.

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) The password for the keystore.

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password`

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.truststore.path`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) The path for the keystore that contains the certificates to trust. It must be either a Java keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file.

    You cannot use this setting and `ssl.certificate_authorities` at the same time.


`xpack.notification.email.ssl.truststore.type`
:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#static-cluster-setting)) Set this to `PKCS12` to indicate that the truststore is a PKCS#12 file.

`xpack.notification.email.ssl.truststore.secure_password`
:   ([Secure](docs-content://deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)) Password for the truststore.

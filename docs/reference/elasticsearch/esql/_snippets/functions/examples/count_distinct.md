% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1)
```

| COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0):long | COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1):long |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |

With the optional second parameter to configure the precision threshold

```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0, 80000), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1, 5)
```

| COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0, 80000):long | COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1, 5):long |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 9 |

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into multiple values using the `SPLIT` function and counts the unique values

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS distinct_word_count = COUNT_DISTINCT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

| distinct_word_count:long |
| --- |
| 5 |

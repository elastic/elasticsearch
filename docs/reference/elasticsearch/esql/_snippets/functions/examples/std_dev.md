% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS STD_DEV(height)
```

| STD_DEV(height):double |
| --- |
| 0.20637044362020449 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the population standard deviation of each employee’s maximum salary changes, first use `MV_MAX` on each row, and then use `STD_DEV` on the result

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS stddev_salary_change = STD_DEV(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| stddev_salary_change:double |

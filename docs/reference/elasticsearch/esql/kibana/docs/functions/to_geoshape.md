### TO GEOSHAPE
Converts an input value to a `geo_shape` value.
A string will only be successfully converted if it respects the
[WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format.

```esql
ROW wkt = "POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))"
| EVAL geom = TO_GEOSHAPE(wkt)
```

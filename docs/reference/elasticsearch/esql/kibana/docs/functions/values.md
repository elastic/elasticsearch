### VALUES
Returns unique values as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values isn’t guaranteed.
If you need the values returned in order use
[`MV_SORT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/mv-functions#esql-mv_sort).

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name = MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```

# Completion field type [completion]

To use the `completion` suggester, map the field from which you want to generate suggestions as type `completion`. This indexes the field values for fast completions.

```console
PUT music
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "suggest": {
        "type": "completion"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Parameters for `completion` fields [_parameters_for_completion_fields]

The following parameters are accepted by `completion` fields:

[`analyzer`](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/analyzer.md)
:   The index analyzer to use, defaults to `simple`.

[`search_analyzer`](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/search-analyzer.md)
:   The search analyzer to use, defaults to value of `analyzer`.

`preserve_separators`
:   Preserves the separators, defaults to `true`. If disabled, you could find a field starting with `Foo Fighters`, if you suggest for `foof`.

`preserve_position_increments`
:   Enables position increments, defaults to `true`. If disabled and using stopwords analyzer, you could get a field starting with `The Beatles`, if you suggest for `b`. **Note**: You could also achieve this by indexing two inputs, `Beatles` and `The Beatles`, no need to change a simple analyzer, if you are able to enrich your data.

`max_input_length`
:   Limits the length of a single input, defaults to `50` UTF-16 code points. This limit is only used at index time to reduce the total number of characters per input string in order to prevent massive inputs from bloating the underlying datastructure. Most use cases wonâ€™t be influenced by the default value since prefix completions seldom grow beyond prefixes longer than a handful of characters.

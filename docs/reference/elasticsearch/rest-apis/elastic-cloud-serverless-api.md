# Elastic Cloud Serverless Project Management API [serverless-project-management-api]

You can manage serverless projects using the [Elastic Cloud Serverless Project Management APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless/).

The available APIs are grouped by project type:

- APIs for [Search projects](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless/group/endpoint-elasticsearch-projects)
- APIs for [Observatibility projects](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless/group/endpoint-observability-projects)
- APIs for [Security projects](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless/group/endpoint-security-projects)

The following examples show how to interact with the APIs, covering common operations such as:
- [Creating a project](#general-manage-project-with-api-create-a-serverless-elasticsearch-project)
- [Retrieving project details](#general-manage-project-with-api-get-project)
- [Retrieving the project's status](#general-manage-project-with-api-get-project-status)
- [Resetting credentials](#general-manage-project-with-api-reset-credentials)
- [Deleting a project](#general-manage-project-with-api-delete-project)
- [Updating a project](#general-manage-project-with-api-update-project)
- [Listing regions where projects can be created](#general-manage-project-with-api-list-available-regions)

## Set up an API key

1. [Create an API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/api-keys/elastic-cloud-api-keys).
2. Store the generated API key as an environment variable so that you donâ€™t need to specify it again for each request:

```console
export API_KEY="YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY"
```

## Create an {{es-serverless}} project [general-manage-project-with-api-create-a-serverless-elasticsearch-project]

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch" \
     -XPOST --data '{
        "name": "My project",  <1>
        "region_id": "aws-us-east-1"  <2>
     }'
```
1. Replace `My project` with a more descriptive name in this call.
2. You can obtain a [list of available regions](#general-manage-project-with-api-list-available-regions). 

The response from the create project request will include the created project details, such as the project ID, the credentials to access the project, and the endpoints to access different apps such as {{es}} and {{kib}}.

Example of `Create project` response:

```console-response
{
    "id": "cace8e65457043698ed3d99da2f053f6",
    "endpoints": {
        "elasticsearch": "https://sample-project-c990cb.es.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud",
        "kibana": "https://sample-project-c990cb-c990cb.kb.us-east-1.aws.elastic.cloud"
    },
    "credentials": {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "abcd12345"
    }
    (...)
}
```

You can store the project ID as an environment variable for the next requests:

```console
export PROJECT_ID=cace8e65457043698ed3d99da2f053f6
```

## Get project [general-manage-project-with-api-get-project]

You can retrieve your project details through an API call:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}"
```

## Get project status [general-manage-project-with-api-get-project-status]

The 'status' endpoint indicates whether the project is initialized and ready to be used. In the response, the project's `phase` will change from "initializing" to "initialized" when it is ready:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}/status"
```

Example response:

```console-response
{
    "phase":"initializing"
}
```

## Reset Credentials [general-manage-project-with-api-reset-credentials]

If you lose the credentials provided at the time of the project creation, you can reset the credentials by using the following endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    -XPOST \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}/_reset-credentials"
```

## Delete Project [general-manage-project-with-api-delete-project]

You can delete your project via the API:

```bash
curl -XDELETE -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}"
```

## Update Project [general-manage-project-with-api-update-project]

You can update your project using a PATCH request. Only the fields included in the body of the request will be updated.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/projects/elasticsearch/${PROJECT_ID}" \
    -XPATCH --data '{
        "name": "new name",
        "alias": "new-project-alias"
     }'
```

## List available regions [general-manage-project-with-api-list-available-regions]

You can obtain the list of regions where projects can be created using the API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/serverless/regions"
```

# Rescorer retriever [rescorer-retriever]

The `rescorer` retriever re-scores only the results produced by its child retriever. For the `standard` and `knn` retrievers, the `window_size` parameter specifies the number of documents examined per shard.

For compound retrievers like `rrf`, the `window_size` parameter defines the total number of documents examined globally.

When using the `rescorer`, an error is returned if the following conditions are not met:

* The minimum configured rescore’s `window_size` is:

    * Greater than or equal to the `size` of the parent retriever for nested `rescorer` setups.
    * Greater than or equal to the `size` of the search request when used as the primary retriever in the tree.

* And the maximum rescore’s `window_size` is:

    * Smaller than or equal to the `size` or `rank_window_size` of the child retriever.

## Parameters [rescorer-retriever-parameters]

`rescore`
:   (Required. [A rescorer definition or an array of rescorer definitions](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/filter-search-results.md#rescore))

    Defines the [rescorers](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/filter-search-results.md#rescore) applied sequentially to the top documents returned by the child retriever.


`retriever`
:   (Required. `retriever`)

    Specifies the child retriever responsible for generating the initial set of top documents to be re-ranked.


`filter`
:   (Optional. [query object or list of query objects](/reference/query-languages/querydsl.md))

    Applies a [boolean query filter](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-bool-query.md) to the retriever, ensuring that all documents match the filter criteria without affecting their scores.



## Example [rescorer-retriever-example]

The `rescorer` retriever can be placed at any level within the retriever tree. The following example demonstrates a `rescorer` applied to the results produced by an `rrf` retriever:

1. Specifies the number of top documents to return in the final response.
2. A `rescorer` retriever applied as the final step.
3. Defines the number of documents to rescore from the child retriever.
4. The definition of the `query` rescorer.
5. Specifies the child retriever definition.
6. Defines the number of documents returned by the `rrf` retriever, which limits the available documents to

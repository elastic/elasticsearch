# {{es}} privileges [security-privileges]

This section provides detailed **reference information** for Elasticsearch privileges.

If you're using a stack-versioned deployment such as a self-managed cluster, {{ech}}, {{eck}}, or {{ece}}, then refer to [User roles](docs-content://deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/user-roles.md) for more information on how role-based access control works.

If you're using {{serverless-full}}, then refer to [Serverless project custom roles](docs-content://deploy-manage/users-roles/serverless-custom-roles.md) to learn how to build roles using these privileges.

:::{note}
In {{serverless-full}}, Elastic manages the underlying infrastructure for you. Because of this, privileges related to cluster administration, scaling, snapshots, and availability are not available. [Learn more about the features managed by {{serverless-full}}](docs-content://deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/differences-from-other-elasticsearch-offerings.md).
:::

Roles are governed by a set of configurable privileges grouped into these categories:

* [cluster](#privileges-list-cluster), which you can use to manage core operations like snapshots, managing API keys, autoscaling, and cross-cluster functionality.
* [indices](#privileges-list-indices), which govern document-level access, index and data stream metadata information, and more.
* [run-as](#_run_as_privilege), which allows for secure impersonation.
* [application](#application-privileges), which enable external applications to define and store their privilege models within {{es}} roles.

When creating roles, refer to this page for a complete list of available privileges.

## Cluster privileges [privileges-list-cluster]

`all`
:   All cluster administration operations, like snapshotting, node shutdown/restart, settings update, rerouting, or managing users and roles.

## Indices privileges [privileges-list-indices]

`all`
:   Any action on an index or data stream.

`auto_configure`
:   Permits auto-creation of indices and data streams. An auto-create action is the result of an [index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) or [bulk](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk) request that targets a non-existent index or data stream rather than an explicit [create index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create) or [create data stream](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create-data-stream) request. Also permits auto-update of mappings on indices and data streams if they do not contradict existing mappings. An auto-update mapping action is the result of an index or bulk request on an index or data stream that contains new fields that may be mapped rather than an explicit [update mapping](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) request.

`create`
:   Privilege to index documents.

    ::::{note}
    This privilege does not restrict the index operation to the creation of documents but instead restricts API use to the index API. The index API allows a user to overwrite a previously indexed document. See the `create_doc` privilege for an alternative.
    ::::

    :::{important}
    Starting from 8.0, this privilege no longer grants the permission to update index mappings.
    In earlier versions, it implicitly permitted index mapping updates (excluding data stream mappings) via the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or through [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md).
    Mapping update capabilities will be fully removed in a future major release.
    :::


`create_doc`
:   Privilege to index documents. It does not grant the permission to update or overwrite existing documents.

    ::::{note}
    This privilege relies on the `op_type` of indexing requests ([Index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) and [Bulk](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk)). When ingesting documents as a user who has the `create_doc` privilege (and no higher privilege such as `index` or `write`), you must ensure that *op_type* is set to *create* through one of the following:

    * Explicitly setting the `op_type` in the index or bulk APIs
    * Using the `_create` endpoint for the index API
    * Creating a document with an auto-generated `_id`

    ::::

    :::{important}
    Starting from 8.0, this privilege no longer grants the permission to update index mappings.
    In earlier versions, it implicitly permitted index mapping updates (excluding data stream mappings) via the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or through [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md).
    Mapping update capabilities will be fully removed in a future major release.
    :::


`create_index` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable`
:   Privilege to create an index or data stream. A create index request may contain aliases to be added to the index once created. In that case the request requires the `manage` privilege as well, on both the index and the aliases names.

`cross_cluster_replication` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable`
:   Privileges to perform cross-cluster replication for indices located on [remote clusters configured with the API key based model](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md). This privilege should only be used for the `privileges` field of [remote indices privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html#roles-remote-indices-priv).


`cross_cluster_replication_internal` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable`
:   Privileges to perform supporting actions for cross-cluster replication from [remote clusters configured with the API key based model](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md).

    ::::{note}
    This privilege must *not* be directly granted. It is used internally by [Create Cross-Cluster API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-create-cross-cluster-api-key) and [Update Cross-Cluster API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-update-cross-cluster-api-key) to manage cross-cluster API keys.
    ::::


`delete`
:   Privilege to delete documents.

`delete_index`
:   Privilege to delete an index or data stream.

`index`
:   Privilege to index and update documents.

    :::{important}
    Starting from 8.0, this privilege no longer grants the permission to update index mappings.
    In earlier versions, it implicitly permitted index mapping updates (excluding data stream mappings) via the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or through [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md).
    Mapping update capabilities will be fully removed in a future major release.

`manage_failure_store` {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1`
:   All `monitor` privileges plus index and data stream administration limited to failure stores only. Applies only to data streams when accessed through the [index component selector syntax](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/api-conventions.md#api-component-selectors).

`manage_follow_index` {applies_to}`serverless: unavailable`
:   All actions that are required to manage the lifecycle of a follower index, which includes creating a follower index, closing it, and converting it to a regular index. This privilege is necessary only on clusters that contain follower indices.

Required for access to failure store data (count, explain, get, mget, get indexed scripts, more like this, multi percolate/search/termvector, percolate, scroll, clear_scroll, search, suggest, tv). Applies only to data streams when accessed through the [index component selector syntax](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/api-conventions.md#api-component-selectors).

`view_index_metadata`
:   Read-only access to index and data stream metadata (aliases, exists, field capabilities, field mappings, get index, get data stream, ilm explain, mappings, search shards, settings, validate query). This privilege is available for use primarily by {{kib}} users.

`write`
:   Privilege to perform all write operations to documents, which includes the permission to index, update, and delete documents as well as performing bulk operations, while also allowing to dynamically update the index mapping.

    :::{important}
    Starting from 8.0, this privilege no longer grants the permission to update index mappings.
    In earlier versions, it implicitly permitted index mapping updates (excluding data stream mappings) via the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or through [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md).
    Mapping update capabilities will be fully removed in a future major release.
    :::

## Run as privilege [_run_as_privilege]
```{applies_to}
serverless: unavailable
```

The `run_as` permission enables an authenticated user to submit requests on behalf of another user. The value can be a user name or a comma-separated list of user names. (You can also specify users as an array of strings or a YAML sequence.) For more information, see [Submitting requests on behalf of other users](docs-content://deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/submitting-requests-on-behalf-of-other-users.md).


## Application privileges [application-privileges]

Application privileges are managed within {{es}} and can be retrieved with the [has privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-has-privileges) and the [get application privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-get-privileges). They do not, however, grant access to any actions or resources within {{es}}. Their purpose is to enable applications to represent and store their own privilege models within {{es}} roles.

To create application privileges, use the [add application privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-put-privileges). You can then associate these application privileges with roles, as described in [Defining roles](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html).

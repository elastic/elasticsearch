## Indices privileges [privileges-list-indices]

`all`
:   Any action on an index or data stream.

`auto_configure`
:   Permits auto-creation of indices and data streams. An auto-create action is the result of an [index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) or [bulk](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk) request that targets a non-existent index or data stream rather than an explicit [create index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create) or [create data stream](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create-data-stream) request. Also permits auto-update of mappings on indices and data streams if they do not contradict existing mappings. An auto-update mapping action is the result of an index or bulk request on an index or data stream that contains new fields that may be mapped rather than an explicit [update mapping](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) request.

`create`
:   Privilege to index documents.

    [8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but not the data streams mapping), using the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or by relying on [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md). In a future major release, this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.

    ::::{note}
    This privilege does not restrict the index operation to the creation of documents but instead restricts API use to the index API. The index API allows a user to overwrite a previously indexed document. See the `create_doc` privilege for an alternative.
    ::::


`create_doc`
:   Privilege to index documents. It does not grant the permission to update or overwrite existing documents.

    [8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but not the data streams mapping), using the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or by relying on [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md). In a future major release, this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.

    ::::{note}
    This privilege relies on the `op_type` of indexing requests ([Index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) and [Bulk](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk)). When ingesting documents as a user who has the `create_doc` privilege (and no higher privilege such as `index` or `write`), you must ensure that *op_type* is set to *create* through one of the following:

    * Explicitly setting the `op_type` in the index or bulk APIs
    * Using the `_create` endpoint for the index API
    * Creating a document with an auto-generated `_id`

    ::::


`create_index`
:   Privilege to create an index or data stream. A create index request may contain aliases to be added to the index once created. In that case the request requires the `manage` privilege as well, on both the index and the aliases names.

`cross_cluster_replication`
:   Privileges to perform cross-cluster replication for indices located on [remote clusters configured with the API key based model](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md). This privilege should only be used for the `privileges` field of [remote indices privileges](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html#roles-remote-indices-priv).

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


`cross_cluster_replication_internal`
:   Privileges to perform supporting actions for cross-cluster replication from [remote clusters configured with the API key based model](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md).

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.

    ::::{note}
    This privilege should *not* be directly granted. It is used internally by [Create Cross-Cluster API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-create-cross-cluster-api-key) and [Update Cross-Cluster API key](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-update-cross-cluster-api-key) to manage cross-cluster API keys.
    ::::


`delete`
:   Privilege to delete documents.

`delete_index`
:   Privilege to delete an index or data stream.

`index`
:   Privilege to index and update documents.

    [8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but not the data streams mapping), using the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping) or by relying on [dynamic field mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/dynamic-mapping.md). In a future major release, this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.


`maintenance`
:   Permits refresh, flush, synced flush and force merge index administration operations. No privilege to read or write index data or otherwise manage the index.

`manage`
:   All `monitor` privileges plus index and data stream administration (aliases, analyze, cache clear, close, delete, exists, flush, mapping, open, field capabilities, force merge, refresh, settings, search shards, validate query).

`manage_data_stream_lifecycle`
:   All [Data stream lifecycle](docs-content://manage-data/lifecycle/data-stream.md) operations relating to reading and managing the built-in lifecycle of a data stream. This includes operations such as adding and removing a lifecycle from a data stream.

`manage_follow_index`
:   All actions that are required to manage the lifecycle of a follower index, which includes creating a follower index, closing it, and converting it to a regular index. This privilege is necessary only on clusters that contain follower indices.

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


`manage_ilm`
:   All {{Ilm}} operations relating to managing the execution of policies of an index or data stream. This includes operations such as retrying policies and removing a policy from an index or data stream.

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


`manage_leader_index`
:   All actions that are required to manage the lifecycle of a leader index, which includes [forgetting a follower](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ccr-forget-follower). This privilege is necessary only on clusters that contain leader indices.

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


`monitor`
:   All actions that are required for monitoring (recovery, segments info, index stats and status).

`read`
:   Read-only access to actions (count, explain, get, mget, get indexed scripts, more like this, multi percolate/search/termvector, percolate, scroll, clear_scroll, search, suggest, tv).

`read_cross_cluster`
:   Read-only access to the search action from a [remote cluster](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-self-managed.md).

    This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


`view_index_metadata`
:   Read-only access to index and data stream metadata (aliases, exists, field capabilities, field mappings, get index, get data stream, ilm explain, mappings, search shards, settings, validate query). This privilege is available for use primarily by {{kib}} users.

`write`
:   Privilege to perform all write operations to documents, which includes the permission to index, update, and delete documents as well as performing bulk operations, while also allowing to dynamically update the index mapping.

    [8.0] It also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but not the data streams mapping), using the [updating mapping API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-mapping). This will be retracted in a future major release.



## Run as privilege [_run_as_privilege]

The `run_as` permission enables an authenticated user to submit requests on behalf of another user. The value can be a user name or a comma-separated list of user names. (You can also specify users as an array of strings or a YAML sequence.) For more information, see [Submitting requests on behalf of other users](docs-content://deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/submitting-requests-on-behalf-of-other-users.md).

This privilege is not available in {{serverless-full}}.


## Application privileges [application-privileges]

Application privileges are managed within {{es}} and can be retrieved with the [has privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-has-privileges) and the [get application privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-get-privileges). They do not, however, grant access to any actions or resources within {{es}}. Their purpose is to enable applications to represent and store their own privilege models within {{es}} roles.

To create application privileges, use the [add application privileges API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-put-privileges). You can then associate these application privileges with roles, as described in [Defining roles](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html).

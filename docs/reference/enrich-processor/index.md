# Ingest processor reference [processors]


An [ingest pipeline](docs-content://manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md) is made up of a sequence of processors that are applied to documents as they are ingested into an index. Each processor performs a specific task, such as filtering, transforming, or enriching data.

Each successive processor depends on the output of the previous processor, so the order of processors is important. The modified documents are indexed into {{es}} after all processors are applied.

{{es}} includes over 40 configurable processors. The subpages in this section contain reference documentation for each processor. To get a list of available processors, use the [nodes info](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-info) API.

```console
GET _nodes/ingest?filter_path=nodes.*.ingest.processors
```

## Add additional processors [ingest-process-plugins]

You can install additional processors as [plugins](../../elasticsearch-plugins/index.md).

You must install any plugin processors on all nodes in your cluster. Otherwise, {{es}} will fail to create pipelines containing the processor.

Mark a plugin as mandatory by setting `plugin.mandatory` in `elasticsearch.yml`. A node will fail to start if a mandatory plugin is not installed.

```yaml
plugin.mandatory: my-ingest-plugin
```

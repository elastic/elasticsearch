== Example: Detect threats with EQL

beta::[]

This example tutorial shows how you can use EQL to detect security threats and
other suspicious behavior. In the scenario, you're tasked with detecting
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010/[regsvr32 misuse] in Windows event
logs.

`regsvr32.exe` is a built-in command-line utility used to register `.dll`
libraries in Windows. As a native tool, `regsvr32.exe` has a trusted status in
Windows, letting it bypass most allowlist software and script blockers.
Attackers with access to a user's command line can use `regsvr32.exe` to run
malicious scripts using `.dll` libraries, even on machines that otherwise
disallow such scripts.

One common variant of regsvr32 misuse is a
https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010/[Squiblydoo attack]. In a
Squiblydoo attack, a `regsvr32.exe` command uses the `scrobj.dll` library to
register and run a remote script. These commands often look like this:

[source,sh]
----
"regsvr32.exe  /s /u /i:<script-url> scrobj.dll"

[[eql-ex-threat-detection-setup]]
=== Setup

This tutorial uses a test dataset for regsvr32 misuse from
https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team[Atomic Red Team]. The dataset has
been normalized and mapped to use fields from the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common
Schema (ECS)], including the `@timestamp` and `event.category` fields. The
dataset includes events that imitate behaviors of a Squiblydoo attack, as
documented in the https://attack.mitre.org[MITRE ATT&CK®] knowledge base.

To get started, download and index the dataset:

. Download the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/elasticsearch/{branch}/docs/src/test/resources/normalized-T1117-AtomicRed-regsvr32.json[`normalized-T1117-AtomicRed-regsvr32.json`] dataset.

. Index the data into `my-index-000001` with the following <<docs-bulk,bulk
API>> request:
+
[source,sh]
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/my-index-000001/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary "@normalized-T1117-AtomicRed-regsvr32.json"
----
// NOTCONSOLE

. Use the <<cat-indices,cat indices API>> to verify the data was successfully
indexed.
+
[source,console]
----
GET /_cat/indices/my-index-000001?v&h=health,status,index,docs.count
----
// TEST[setup:atomic_red_regsvr32]
+
The API response should show a `docs.count` value of `150`, indicating 150
documents were indexed.

[[eql-ex-get-a-count-of-regsvr32-events]]
=== Get a count of regsvr32 events

Since you're looking for regsvr32 misuse, start by getting a count of any
events associated with a `regsvr32.exe` process.

The following <<eql-search-api,EQL search API>> request uses an EQL query to
retrieve a count of events with a `process.name` of `regsvr32.exe`. The query
starts with the <<eql-syntax-match-any-event-category,`any where` keywords>>,
meaning the query can match events of any <<eql-required-fields,event
category>>.

[source,console]
----
GET /my-index-000001/_eql/search?filter_path=-hits.events   <1>
{
  "query": """
    any where process.name == "regsvr32.exe"                <2>
  """,
  "size": 200                                               <3>
}
----
// TEST[setup:atomic_red_regsvr32]

<1> Uses the `?filter_path=-hits.events` query parameter to exclude the
`hits.events` property from the response. The `hits.events` property contains
the document source for any matching events. This request is intended to
retrieve a count of events only.
<2> Uses an EQL query to match events with a `process.name` of `regsvr32.exe`.
<3> Returns up to 200 events or sequences matching the EQL query.

The request returns the following response, indicating that 143 events match the
query.

[[eql-ex-check-for-command-line-artifacts]]
=== Check for command line artifacts

Based on your previous query, you know regsvr32 processes were associated with
143 events. But how was `regsvr32.exe` first called? And who called it?

`regsvr32.exe` is a command-line utility so it may help to narrow your results
to processes where the command line was used.

Update the previous EQL query as follows:

* Change the `any` keyword to `process`. This limits matches to events with an
`event.category` of `process`.
* Add the `and process.command_line.keyword != null` condition to match only
events with a command line value.

You'll also need to remove the `filter_path=-hits.events` query parameter. This
lets you retrieve the document source for any matching events.

[source,console]
----
GET /my-index-000001/_eql/search
{
  "query": """
    process where process.name == "regsvr32.exe" and process.command_line.keyword != null
  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:atomic_red_regsvr32]

The query matches one process event. The event has an `event.type` of
`creation`, indicating the start of a `regsvr32.exe` process.

Based on the `process.command_line` value in the response, `regsvr32.exe` used
`scrobj.dll` to register a script, `RegSvr32.sct`. This fits the behavior of a
Squiblydoo attack.

The response also includes other valuable information about how the
`regsvr32.exe` process started, such as the `@timestamp`, the associated
`user.id`, and the `process.parent.name`.

[[eql-ex-check-for-malicious-script-loads]]
=== Check for malicious script loads

You now know that a `regsvr32.exe` process was used to register a potentially
malicious script, `RegSvr32.sct`. Next, see if `regsvr32.exe` later loads the
`scrobj.dll` library.

Modify the previous EQL query as follows:

* Change the `process` keyword to `library`.
* Replace the `process.command_line.keyword != null` condition with
`dll.name == "scrobj.dll`.

[source,console]
----

[[eql-ex-detemine-likelihood-of-sucess]]
=== Determine the likelihood of success

In many cases, malicious scripts are used to connect to remote servers or
download other files. If this occurred, the attack might have succeeded.

Use an <<eql-sequences,EQL sequence query>> to check for the following series of
events, in order:

. A `regsvr32.exe` process, which could have been used to register malicious
scripts as `scrobj.dll`
. A load of the `scrobj.dll` library by the same process
. Any network event by the same process, which could indicate the download of a
remote file

To match, each event in the sequence must share the same process ID, recorded in
the `process.pid` field.

Based on the command line value seen in the previous result, you can expect to
find a match. However, the sequence query isn't designed for that specific
command. Instead, it looks for a pattern of suspicious behavior while still
being generic enough to detect similar threats in the future.

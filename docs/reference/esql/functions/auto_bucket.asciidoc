=== `AUTO_BUCKET`

experimental::[]

*Syntax*

[source,esql]
----
AUTO_BUCKET(expression, buckets, from, to)
----

*Parameters*

`field`::
Numeric or date expression from which to derive buckets.

`buckets`::
Target number of buckets.

`from`::
Start of the range. Can be a number or a date expressed as a string.

`to`::
End of the range. Can be a number or a date expressed as a string.

*Description*

Creates human-friendly buckets and returns a value for each row that corresponds
to the resulting bucket the row falls into. 

Using a target number of buckets, a start of a range, and an end of a range,
`AUTO_BUCKET` picks an appropriate bucket size to generate the target number of
buckets or fewer. For example, asking for at most 20 buckets over a year results
in monthly buckets:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketMonth]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketMonth-result]
|===

The goal isn't to provide *exactly* the target number of buckets, it's to pick a
range that people are comfortable with that provides at most the target number
of buckets.

Combine `AUTO_BUCKET` with
<<esql-stats-by>> to create a histogram:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketMonthlyHistogram]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketMonthlyHistogram-result]
|===

NOTE: `AUTO_BUCKET` does not create buckets that don't match any documents.
That's why this example is missing `1985-03-01` and other dates.

Asking for more buckets can result in a smaller range. For example, asking for
at most 100 buckets in a year results in weekly buckets:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketWeeklyHistogram]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketWeeklyHistogram-result]
|===

NOTE: `AUTO_BUCKET` does not filter any rows. It only uses the provided range to
pick a good bucket size. For rows with a value outside of the range, it returns
a bucket value that corresponds to a bucket outside the range. Combine
`AUTO_BUCKET` with <<esql-where>> to filter rows.

`AUTO_BUCKET` can also operate on numeric fields. For example, to create a
salary histogram:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/ints.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketNumeric]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/ints.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketNumeric-result]
|===

Unlike the earlier example that intentionally filters on a date range, you
rarely want to filter on a numeric range. You have to find the `min` and `max`
separately. {esql} doesn't yet have an easy way to do that automatically.

*Examples*

Create hourly buckets for the last 24 hours, and calculate the number of events
per hour:


[source.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=docsAutoBucketLast24hr]
----

Create monthly buckets for the year 1985, and calculate the average salary by
hiring month:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=auto_bucket_in_agg]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/date.csv-spec[tag=auto_bucket_in_agg-result]

==== Equality
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/equals.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if two fields are equal. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>> then
the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/equals.asciidoc[]

==== Inequality `!=`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/not_equals.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if two fields are unequal. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>> then
the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/not_equals.asciidoc[]

==== Less than `<`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/less_than.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if one field is less than another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/less_than.asciidoc[]

==== Less than or equal to `<=`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/less_than_or_equal.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if one field is less than or equal to another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/less_than_or_equal.asciidoc[]

==== Greater than `>`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/greater_than.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if one field is greater than another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/greater_than.asciidoc[]

==== Greater than or equal to `>=`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/greater_than_or_equal.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Check if one field is greater than or equal to another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

NOTE: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant
      and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

Supported types:

include::types/greater_than_or_equal.asciidoc[]

==== Add `+`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/add.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Add two numbers together. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

Supported types:

include::types/add.asciidoc[]

==== Subtract `-`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/sub.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Subtract one number from another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

Supported types:

include::types/sub.asciidoc[]

==== Multiply `*`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/mul.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Multiply two numbers together. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

Supported types:

include::types/mul.asciidoc[]

==== Divide `/`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/div.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Divide one number by another. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

NOTE: Division of two integer types will yield an integer result, rounding towards 0.
      If you need floating point division, <<esql-cast-operator>> one of the arguments to a `DOUBLE`.

Supported types:

include::types/div.asciidoc[]

==== Modulus `%`
[.text-center]
image::esql/functions/signature/mod.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

Divide one number by another and return the remainder. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>>
then the result is `null`.

Supported types:

include::types/mod.asciidoc[]

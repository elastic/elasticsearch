*Description*

Use `MATCH` to perform a <<query-dsl-match-query,match query>> on the specified field. Using `MATCH` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.  Match can be used on text fields, as well as other field types like boolean, dates, and numeric types.  For a simplified syntax, you can use the <<esql-search-operators,match operator>> `:` operator instead of `MATCH`.  `MATCH` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

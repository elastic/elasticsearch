*Description*

Use `MATCH` to perform a <<query-dsl-match-query,match query>> on the specified field. Using `MATCH` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.  Match can be used on fields from the text family like <<text, text>> and <<semantic-text, semantic_text>>, as well as other field types like keyword, boolean, dates, and numeric types.  Match can use <<esql-function-named-params,function named parameters>> to specify additional options for the match query. All <<match-field-params,match query parameters>> are supported.  For a simplified syntax, you can use the <<esql-search-operators,match operator>> `:` operator instead of `MATCH`.  `MATCH` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

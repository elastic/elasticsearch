*Description*

Use `MATCH_PHRASE` to perform a [`match_phrase`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.md) on the specified field. Using `MATCH_PHRASE` is equivalent to using the `match_phrase` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.  MatchPhrase can be used on <<text, text>> fields, as well as other field types like keyword, boolean, or date types. MatchPhrase is not supported for <<semantic-text, semantic_text>> or numeric types.  MatchPhrase can use <<esql-function-named-params,function named parameters>> to specify additional options for the match_phrase query. All [`match_phrase`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.md) query parameters are supported.  `MATCH_PHRASE` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

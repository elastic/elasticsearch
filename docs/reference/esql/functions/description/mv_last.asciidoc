*Description*

Converts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like <<esql-split>>.

The order that <<esql-multivalued-fields, multivalued fields>> are read from
underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is *frequently* ascending, but don't
rely on that. If you need the maximum value use <<esql-mv_max>> instead of
`MV_LAST`. `MV_MAX` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn't a
performance benefit to `MV_LAST`.

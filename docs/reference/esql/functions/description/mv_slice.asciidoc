*Description*

Returns a subset of the multivalued field using the start and end index values. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns in a known order like <<esql-split>> or <<esql-mv_sort>>.

The order that <<esql-multivalued-fields, multivalued fields>> are read from
underlying storage is not guaranteed. It is *frequently* ascending, but don't
rely on that.

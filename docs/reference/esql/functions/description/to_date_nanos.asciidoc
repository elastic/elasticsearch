*Description*

Converts an input to a nanosecond-resolution date value (aka date_nanos).

NOTE: The range for date nanos is 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z, attepting to convertvalues outside of that range will result in null with a warning..  Additionally, integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the range of integer nanoseconds only covers about 2 seconds after epoch.

*Description*

Converts an input value to a date value. A string will only be successfully converted if it's respecting the format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'`. To convert dates in other formats, use <<esql-date_parse>>.

NOTE: Note that when converting from nanosecond resolution to millisecond resolution with this function, the nanosecond date is truncated, not rounded.

*Example*

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/floats.csv-spec[tag=to_double-str]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/floats.csv-spec[tag=to_double-str-result]
|===

Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isn't possible.
When this happens, the result is a *null* value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:115: evaluation of [TO_DOUBLE(str2)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:
`"java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "foo""`

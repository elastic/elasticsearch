*Example*

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/ints.csv-spec[tag=to_int-long]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/ints.csv-spec[tag=to_int-long-result]
|===

Note that in this example, the last value of the multi-valued field cannot be converted as an integer.
When this happens, the result is a *null* value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:61: evaluation of [TO_INTEGER(long)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

`"org.elasticsearch.xpack.ql.InvalidArgumentException: [501379200000] out of [integer] range"`

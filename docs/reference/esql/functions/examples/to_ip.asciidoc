*Example*

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/ip.csv-spec[tag=to_ip]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/ip.csv-spec[tag=to_ip-result]
|===

Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isn't possible.
When this happens, the result is a *null* value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:68: evaluation of [TO_IP(str2)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

`"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'foo' is not an IP string literal."`

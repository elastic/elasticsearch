name | types | description
fuzziness | [keyword] | Maximum edit distance allowed for matching.
auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query | [boolean] | If true, match phrase queries are automatically created for multi-term synonyms. Defaults to true.
analyzer | [keyword] | Analyzer used to convert the text in the query value into token. Defaults to the index-time analyzer mapped for the field. If no analyzer is mapped, the index’s default analyzer is used.
minimum_should_match | [integer] | Minimum number of clauses that must match for a document to be returned.
zero_terms_query | [keyword] | Indicates whether all documents or none are returned if the analyzer removes all tokens, such as when using a stop filter. Defaults to none.
boost | [float] | Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of the query. Defaults to 1.0.
fuzzy_transpositions | [boolean] | If true, edits for fuzzy matching include transpositions of two adjacent characters (ab → ba). Defaults to true.
fuzzy_rewrite | [keyword] | Method used to rewrite the query. See the rewrite parameter for valid values and more information. If the fuzziness parameter is not 0, the match query uses a fuzzy_rewrite method of top_terms_blended_freqs_${max_expansions} by default.
prefix_length | [integer] | Number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching. Defaults to 0.
lenient | [boolean] | If false, format-based errors, such as providing a text query value for a numeric field, are returned. Defaults to false.
operator | [keyword] | Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value. Defaults to OR.
max_expansions | [integer] | Maximum number of terms to which the query will expand. Defaults to 50.

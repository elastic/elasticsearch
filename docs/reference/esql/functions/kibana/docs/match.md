### MATCH
Use `MATCH` to perform a <<query-dsl-match-query,match query>> on the specified field.
Using `MATCH` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.

Match can be used on text fields, as well as other field types like boolean, dates, and numeric types.

For a simplified syntax, you can use the <<esql-search-operators,match operator>> `:` operator instead of `MATCH`.

`MATCH` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

```
FROM books 
| WHERE MATCH(author, "Faulkner")
| KEEP book_no, author 
| SORT book_no 
| LIMIT 5;
```

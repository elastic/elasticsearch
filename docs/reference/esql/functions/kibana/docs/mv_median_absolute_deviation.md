### MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION
Converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the median absolute deviation.

It is calculated as the median of each data point's deviation from the median of the entire sample. That is, for a random variable `X`, the median absolute deviation is `median(|median(X) - X|)`.

```
ROW values = [0, 2, 5, 6]
| EVAL median_absolute_deviation = MV_MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(values), median = MV_MEDIAN(values)
```
Note: If the field has an even number of values, the medians will be calculated as the average of the middle two values. If the value is not a floating point number, the averages are rounded towards 0.

### MV_PSERIES_WEIGHTED_SUM
Converts a multivalued expression into a single-valued column by multiplying every element on the input list by its corresponding term in P-Series and computing the sum.

```
ROW a = [70.0, 45.0, 21.0, 21.0, 21.0]
| EVAL sum = MV_PSERIES_WEIGHTED_SUM(a, 1.5)
| KEEP sum
```

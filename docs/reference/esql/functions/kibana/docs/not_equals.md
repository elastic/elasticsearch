### NOT_EQUALS
Check if two fields are unequal. If either field is <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued>> then the result is `null`.

Note: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an <<mapping-index>> and <<doc-values>>.

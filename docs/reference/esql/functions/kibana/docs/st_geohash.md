### ST_GEOHASH
Calculates the `geohash` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use <<esql-st_geohash_to_string>> to convert the result to a string.

These functions are related to the <<query-dsl-geo-grid-query,`geo_grid` query>>
and the <<search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation,`geohash_grid` aggregation>>.

```
FROM airports
| EVAL geohash = ST_GEOHASH(location, 1)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geohash
| WHERE count >= 10
| EVAL geohashString = ST_GEOHASH_TO_STRING(geohash)
| KEEP count, centroid, geohashString
| SORT count DESC, geohashString ASC
```

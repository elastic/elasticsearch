### ST_GEOHEX
Calculates the `geohex`, the H3 cell-id, of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use <<esql-st_geohex_to_string>> to convert the result to a string.

These functions are related to the <<query-dsl-geo-grid-query,`geo_grid` query>>
and the <<search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation,`geohex_grid` aggregation>>.

```
FROM airports
| EVAL geohex = ST_GEOHEX(location, 1)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geohex
| WHERE count >= 10
| EVAL geohexString = ST_GEOHEX_TO_STRING(geohex)
| KEEP count, centroid, geohexString
| SORT count DESC, geohexString ASC
```

### ST_GEOTILE
Calculates the `geotile` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use <<esql-st_geotile_to_string>> to convert the result to a string.

These functions are related to the <<query-dsl-geo-grid-query,`geo_grid` query>>
and the <<search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation,`geotile_grid` aggregation>>.

```
FROM airports
| EVAL geotile = ST_GEOTILE(location, 2)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geotile
| EVAL geotileString = ST_GEOTILE_TO_STRING(geotile)
| SORT count DESC, geotileString ASC
| KEEP count, centroid, geotileString
```

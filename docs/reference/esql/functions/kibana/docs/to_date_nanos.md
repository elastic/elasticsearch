### TO_DATE_NANOS
Converts an input to a nanosecond-resolution date value (aka date_nanos).

Note: The range for date nanos is 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z.  Additionally, integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the range of integer nanoseconds only covers about 2 seconds after epoch.

### TO_DOUBLE
Converts an input value to a double value. If the input parameter is of a date type,
its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch,
converted to double. Boolean *true* will be converted to double *1.0*, *false* to *0.0*.

```
ROW str1 = "5.20128E11", str2 = "foo"
| EVAL dbl = TO_DOUBLE("520128000000"), dbl1 = TO_DOUBLE(str1), dbl2 = TO_DOUBLE(str2)
```

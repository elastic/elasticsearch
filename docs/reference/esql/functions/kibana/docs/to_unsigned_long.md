### TO_UNSIGNED_LONG
Converts an input value to an unsigned long value. If the input parameter is of a date type,
its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, converted to unsigned long.
Boolean *true* will be converted to unsigned long *1*, *false* to *0*.

```
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_ULONG(str2), long3 = TO_UL(str3)
```

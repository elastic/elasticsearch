=== `LIKE`

// tag::body[]
Use `LIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using wildcards. `LIKE`
usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can
also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator
represents the pattern.

The following wildcard characters are supported:

* `*` matches zero or more characters.
* `?` matches one character.

Matching the exact characters `*` and `.` will require escaping.
The escape character is backslash `\`. Since also backslash is a special character in string literals,
it will require further escaping.

To reduce the overhead of escaping, we suggest using triple quotes strings `"""`

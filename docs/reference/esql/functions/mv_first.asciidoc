=== `MV_FIRST`

*Syntax*

image::esql/functions/signature/mv_first.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

*Parameters*

`v`::
Multivalue from which to return the first value.

*Description*

Converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the first value. This is most
useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued fields in a known order like <<esql-split>>:

The order that <<esql-multivalued-fields, multivalued fields>> are read from underlying storage is not
guaranteed. It is *frequently* ascending, but don't rely on that. If you need the minimum field value
use <<esql-mv_min>> instead of `MV_FIRST`. `MV_MIN` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn't
a performance benefit to `MV_FIRST`. `MV_FIRST` is mostly useful with functions that create multivalued
fields like `SPLIT`.

*Supported types*

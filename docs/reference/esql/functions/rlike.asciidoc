==== `RLIKE`

// tag::body[]
Use `RLIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using using
<<regexp-syntax,regular expressions>>. `RLIKE` usually acts on a field placed on
the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal)
expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.

Matching special characters (eg. `.`, `*`, `(`...) will require escaping.
The escape character is backslash `\`. Since also backslash is a special character in string literals,
it will require further escaping.

To reduce the overhead of escaping, we suggest using triple quotes strings `"""`

Full text functions are used to search for text in fields.
<<analysis, Text analysiss>> is used to analyze the query before it is searched.

Full text functions can be used to match <<esql-multivalued-fields,multivalued fields>>.
A multivalued field that contains a value that matches a full text query is considered to match the query.

See <<esql-limitations-full-text-search,full text search limitations>> for information on the limitations of full text search.

{esql} supports these full-text search functions:

// tag::search_list[]
* experimental:[] <<esql-match>>
* experimental:[] <<esql-qstr>>
// end::search_list[]

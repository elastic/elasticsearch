=== Search operators

The only search operator is match (`:`).

preview::["Do not use on production environments. This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features."]

The match operator performs a <<query-dsl-match-query,match query>> on the specified field.
Returns true if the provided query matches the row.

The match operator is equivalent to the <<esql-match,match function>>.

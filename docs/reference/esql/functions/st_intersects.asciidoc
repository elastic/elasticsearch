=== `ST_INTERSECTS`

experimental::[]

*Syntax*

image::esql/functions/signature/st_intersects.svg[Embedded,opts=inline]

*Parameters*

`geomA`::
Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape` or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.

`geomB`::
Expression of type `geo_point`, `cartesian_point`, `geo_shape` or `cartesian_shape`. If `null`, the function returns `null`.
The second parameter must also have the same coordinate system as the first.
This means it is not possible to combine `geo_*` and `cartesian_*` parameters.

*Description*

Returns true if two geometries intersect.
They intersect if they have any point in common, including their interior points
(points along lines or within polygons).
In mathematical terms: ST_Intersects(A, B) ⇔ A ⋂ B ≠ ∅

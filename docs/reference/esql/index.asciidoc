The {es} Query Language ({esql}) is a query language that enables the iterative
exploration of data.

An {esql} query consists of a series of commands, separated by pipes. Each query
starts with a <<esql-source-commands,source command>>. A source command produces
a table, typically with data from {es}.

A source command can be followed by one or more
<<esql-processing-commands,processing commands>>. Processing commands change an
input table by adding, removing, or changing rows and columns.

You can chain processing commands, separated by a pipe character: `|`. Each
processing command works on the output table of the previous command.

The result of a query is the table produced by the final processing command.

=== Run an {esql} query

==== The {esql} API

Use the `_query` endpoint to run an {esql} query:

[source,console]
----
POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_TRUNC(1 YEARS, release_date)
    | STATS MAX(page_count) BY year
    | SORT year
    | LIMIT 5
  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:library]

The results come back in rows:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "columns": [
    { "name": "MAX(page_count)", "type": "integer"},
    { "name": "year"           , "type": "date"}
  ],
  "values": [
    [268, "1932-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],
    [224, "1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],
    [227, "1953-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],
    [335, "1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"],
    [604, "1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"]
  ]
}
----

By default, results are returned as JSON. To return results formatted as text,
CSV, or TSV, use the `format` parameter:

[source,console]
----
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_TRUNC(1 YEARS, release_date)
    | STATS MAX(page_count) BY year
    | SORT year
    | LIMIT 5
  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:library]

The above query's `LIMIT` command limits results to 5 rows.

If not specified, `LIMIT` defaults to `500`. A single query will not return
more than 10,000 rows, regardless of the `LIMIT` value.

Use {esql} in Discover to explore a data set. From the data view dropdown,
select *Try {esql}* to get started.

NOTE: {esql} queries in Discover and Lens are subject to the time range selected
with the time filter.

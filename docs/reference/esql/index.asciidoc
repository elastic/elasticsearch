[partintro]

The {es} Query Language ({esql}) provides a powerful way to filter, transform,
and analyze data stored in {es}, and in the future in other runtimes. It is
designed to be easy to learn and use, by end users, SRE teams, application
developers, and administrators.

Users can author {esql} queries to find specific events, perform statistical
analysis, and generate visualizations. It supports a wide range of commands and
functions that enable users to perform various data operations, such as
filtering, aggregation, time-series analysis, and more.

The {es} Query Language ({esql}) makes use of "pipes" (|) to manipulate and
transform data in a step-by-step fashion. This approach allows users to compose
a series of operations, where the output of one operation becomes the input for
the next, enabling complex data transformations and analysis.

=== The {esql} Compute Engine

{esql} is more than a language: it represents a significant investment in new
compute capabilities within {es}. To achieve both the functional and performance
requirements for {esql}, it was necessary to build an entirely new compute
architecture. {esql} search, aggregation, and transformation functions are
directly executed within Elasticsearch itself. Query expressions are not
transpiled to Query DSL for execution. This approach allows {esql} to be
extremely performant and versatile.

The new {esql} execution engine was designed with performance in mind â€” it
operates on blocks at a time instead of per row, targets vectorization and cache
locality, and embraces specialization and multi-threading. It is a separate
component from the existing Elasticsearch aggregation framework with different
performance characteristics.

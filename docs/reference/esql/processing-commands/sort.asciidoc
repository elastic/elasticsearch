=== `SORT`
Use the `SORT` command to sort rows on one or more fields:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=sort]
----

The default sort order is ascending. Set an explicit sort order using `ASC` or
`DESC`:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=sortDesc]
----

If two rows have the same sort key, the original order will be preserved. You
can provide additional sort expressions to act as tie breakers:

[source,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=sortTie]

==== `null` values
By default, `null` values are treated as being larger than any other value. With
an ascending sort order, `null` values are sorted last, and with a descending
sort order, `null` values are sorted first. You can change that by providing
`NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`:

include::{esql-specs}/docs.csv-spec[tag=sortNullsFirst]

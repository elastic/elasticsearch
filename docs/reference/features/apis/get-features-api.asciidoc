You can use the get features API to determine which feature states
to include when <<snapshots-take-snapshot,taking a snapshot>>. By default, all
feature states are included in a snapshot if that snapshot includes the global
state, or none if it does not.

A feature state includes one or more system indices necessary for a given
feature to function. In order to ensure data integrity, all system indices that
comprise a feature state are snapshotted and restored together.

The features listed by this API are a combination of built-in features and
features defined by plugins. In order for a feature's state to be listed in this
API and recognized as a valid feature state by the create snapshot API, the
plugin which defines that feature must be installed on the master node.

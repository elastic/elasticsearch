=== Fleet multi search API
++++
<titleabbrev>Fleet multi search</titleabbrev>
++++

Executes several <<fleet-search,fleet searches>> with a single API request.

The API follows the same structure as the <<search-multi-search, multi search>> API. However,
similar to the fleet search API, it supports the `wait_for_checkpoints` parameter.

NOTE: The fleet multi search API is designed for indirect use through fleet server. Direct use is
not supported. Elastic reserves the right to change or remove this feature in future releases
without prior notice.

`wait_for_checkpoints`::
(Optional, list) A comma separated list of checkpoints. When configured, the search API will
only be executed on a shard after the relevant checkpoint has become visible for search.
Defaults to an empty list which will cause Elasticsearch to immediately execute the search.

`allow_partial_search_results`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, returns partial results if there are shard request timeouts or
<<shard-failures,shard failures>>. If `false`, returns an error with
no partial results. Defaults to the configured cluster setting `search.default_allow_partial_results` which
is `true` by default.

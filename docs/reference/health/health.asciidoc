* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `monitor` or
`manage` <<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

[[health-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The health API returns a report with the health status of an Elasticsearch cluster. The report
contains a list of indicators that compose Elasticsearch functionality.

Each indicator has a health status of: `green`, `unknown`, `yellow` or `red`. The indicator will
provide an explanation and metadata describing the reason for its current health status.

The cluster's status is controlled by the worst indicator status.

In the event that an indicator's status is non-green, a list of impacts may be present in the
indicator result which detail the functionalities that are negatively affected by the health issue.
Each impact carries with it a severity level, an area of the system that is affected, and a simple
description of the impact on the system.

Some health indicators can determine the root cause of a health problem and prescribe a set of
steps that can be performed in order to improve the health of the system. The root cause and remediation
steps are encapsulated in a `diagnosis`.
A diagnosis contains a cause detailing a root cause analysis, an action containing a brief description
of the steps to take to fix the problem, the list of affected resources (if applicable), and a detailed
step-by-step troubleshooting guide to fix the diagnosed problem.

NOTE: The health indicators perform root cause analysis of non-green health statuses. This can
be computationally expensive when called frequently. When setting up automated polling of the API
for health status set `verbose` to `false` to disable the more expensive analysis logic.

[[health-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<indicator>`::
    (Optional, string) Limit the information returned to
    a specific indicator. Supported indicators are:
+
--
  `master_is_stable`::
      Reports health issues regarding
      the stability of the node that is seen as the master by the node handling
      the health request. In case of enough observed master changes in a short period of time
      this indicator will aim to diagnose and report back useful information
      regarding the cluster formation issues it detects.

  `shards_availability`::
      Reports health issues regarding shard assignments.

  `disk`::
      Reports health issues caused by lack of disk space.

  `ilm`::
      Reports health issues related to
      Indexing Lifecycle Management.

  `repository_integrity`::
      Tracks repository integrity and reports health issues
      that arise if repositories become corrupted.

  `slm`::
      Reports health issues related to
      Snapshot Lifecycle Management.

  `shards_capacity`::
      Reports health issues related to the shards
      capacity of the cluster.
--

[[health-api-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

`verbose`::
    (Optional, Boolean) If `true`, the response includes additional details that help explain the status of each non-green indicator.
    These details include additional troubleshooting metrics and sometimes a root cause analysis of a health status.
    Defaults to `true`.

`size`::
    (Optional, integer) The maximum number of affected resources to return.
    As a diagnosis can return multiple types of affected resources this parameter will limit the number of resources returned for each type to the configured value (e.g. a diagnosis could return
    `1000` affected indices and `1000` affected nodes).
    Defaults to `1000`.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _health_report
--------------------------------------------------

The API returns a response with all the indicators regardless
of current status.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _health_report/shards_availability
--------------------------------------------------

The API returns a response for just the shard availability indicator.

[source,console]

GET _health_report?verbose=false

The API returns a response with all health indicators but will
not calculate details or root cause analysis for the response. This is helpful
if you would like to monitor the health API and do not want the overhead of
calculating additional troubleshooting details each call.

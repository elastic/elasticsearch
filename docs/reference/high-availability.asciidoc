Your data is important to you. Keeping it safe and available is important
to {es}. Sometimes your cluster may experience hardware failure or a power
loss. To help you plan for this, {es} offers a number of features
to achieve high availability despite failures.

* With proper planning, a cluster can be
  <<high-availability-cluster-design,designed for resilience>> to many of the
  things that commonly go wrong, from the loss of a single node or network
  connection right up to a zone-wide outage such as power loss.

* You can use <<xpack-ccr,{ccr}>> to replicate data to a remote _follower_
  cluster which may be in a different data centre or even on a different
  continent from the leader cluster. The follower cluster acts as a hot
  standby, ready for you to fail over in the event of a disaster so severe that
  the leader cluster fails. The follower cluster can also act as a geo-replica
  to serve searches from nearby clients.

* The last line of defence against data loss is to take
  <<snapshots-take-snapshot,regular snapshots>> of your cluster so that you can
  restore a completely fresh copy of it elsewhere if needed.

==== Options

`delete_searchable_snapshot`::
(Optional, Boolean)
Deletes the searchable snapshot created in a previous phase.
Defaults to `true`.
This option is applicable when the <<ilm-searchable-snapshot,searchable
snapshot>> action is used in any previous phase.

WARNING: If a policy with a searchable snapshot action is applied on an existing searchable snapshot index,
the snapshot backing this index will NOT be deleted because it was not created by this policy. If you want
to clean this snapshot, please delete it manually after the index is deleted using the <<delete-snapshot-api, delete snapshot API>>, you
can find the repository and snapshot name using the <<indices-get-index, get index API>>.

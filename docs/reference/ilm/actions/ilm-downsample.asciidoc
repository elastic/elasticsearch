=== Downsample

Phases allowed: hot, warm, cold.

Aggregates a time series (TSDS) index and stores
pre-computed statistical summaries (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `value_count` and
`avg`) for each metric field grouped by a configured time interval. For example,
a TSDS index that contains metrics sampled every 10 seconds can be downsampled
to an hourly index. All documents within an hour interval are summarized and
stored as a single document and stored in the downsample index.

This action corresponds to the  <<indices-downsample-data-stream,downsample API>>.

The name of the resulting downsample index is
`downsample-<original-index-name>-<random-uuid>`. If {ilm-init} performs the
`downsample` action on a backing index for a data stream, the downsample index
becomes a backing index for the same stream and the source index is deleted.

To use the `downsample` action in the `hot` phase, the `rollover` action *must*
be present. If no rollover action is configured, {ilm-init} will reject the
policy.

=== Freeze

Phases allowed: cold, frozen.

<<frozen-indices, Freezes>> an index to minimize its memory footprint.

IMPORTANT: Freezing an index closes the index and reopens it within the same API call.
This means that for a short time no primaries are allocated.
The cluster will go red until the primaries are allocated.
This limitation might be removed in the future.

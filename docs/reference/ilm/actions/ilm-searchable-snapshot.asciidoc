=== Searchable snapshot

Phases allowed: hot, cold, frozen.

Takes a snapshot of the managed index in the configured repository and mounts it
as a <<searchable-snapshots,{search-snap}>>. If the index is part of a
<<data-streams, data stream>>, the mounted index replaces the original index in
the stream.

The `searchable_snapshot` action requires <<data-tiers,data tiers>>. The action
uses the
<<tier-preference-allocation-filter,`index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference`>>
setting to mount the index directly to the phase's corresponding data tier. In
the frozen phase, the action mounts a <<partially-mounted,partially mounted
index>> prefixed with `partial-` to the frozen tier. In other phases, the action mounts a
<<fully-mounted,fully mounted index>> prefixed with `restored-` to the corresponding data tier.

In the frozen tier, the action will ignore the setting
<<total-shards-per-node,`index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node`>>, if it was present in the original index,
to account for the difference in the number of nodes between the frozen and the other tiers.


WARNING: Don't include the `searchable_snapshot` action in both the hot and cold
phases. This can result in indices failing to automatically migrate to the cold
tier during the cold phase.

If the `searchable_snapshot` action is used in the hot phase the subsequent
phases cannot include the `shrink` or `forcemerge` actions.

This action cannot be performed on a data stream's write index. Attempts to do
so will fail. To convert the index to a searchable snapshot, first
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,manually roll over>> the data stream. This
creates a new write index. Because the index is no longer the stream's write
index, the action can then convert it to a searchable snapshot.
Using a policy that makes use of the <<ilm-rollover, rollover>> action
in the hot phase will avoid this situation and the need for a manual rollover for future
managed indices.

IMPORTANT: Mounting and relocating the shards of {search-snap} indices involves
copying the shard contents from the snapshot repository. This may incur
different costs from the copying between nodes that happens with regular
indices. These costs are typically lower but, in some environments, may be
higher. See <<searchable-snapshots-costs>> for more details.

By default, this snapshot is deleted by the <<ilm-delete, delete action>> in the delete phase.
To keep the snapshot, set `delete_searchable_snapshot` to `false` in the delete action. This
snapshot retention runs off the index lifecycle management (ILM) policies and is not effected by snapshot lifecycle management (SLM) policies.

==== Options

`snapshot_repository`::
(Required, string)
<<snapshots-register-repository,Repository>> used to store the snapshot.

`force_merge_index`::
(Optional, Boolean)
Force merges the managed index to one segment.
Defaults to `true`.
If the managed index was already force merged using the
<<ilm-forcemerge, force merge action>> in a previous action
the `searchable snapshot` action force merge step will be a no-op.

[NOTE]
Shards that are relocating during a `forcemerge` will not be merged.
The `searchable_snapshot` action will continue executing even if not all shards
are force merged.

This force merging occurs in the phase that the index is in *prior* to the `searchable_snapshot`
action. For example, if using a `searchable_snapshot` action in the `hot` phase, the force merge
will be performed on the hot nodes. If using a `searchable_snapshot` action in the `cold` phase, the
force merge will be performed on whatever tier the index is *prior* to the `cold` phase (either
`hot` or `warm`).

[[ilm-set-priority]]
=== Set priority

Phases allowed: hot, warm, cold, frozen.

Sets the <<recovery-prioritization, priority>> of the index as
soon as the policy enters the hot, warm, or cold phase. 
Higher priority indices are recovered before indices with lower priorities following a node restart. 

Generally, indexes in the hot phase should have the highest value and
indexes in the cold phase should have the lowest values. 
For example: 100 for the hot phase, 50 for the warm phase, and 0 for the cold phase.
Indices that don't set this value have a default priority of 1.

[[ilm-set-priority-options]]
==== Options

`priority`::
(Required, integer)

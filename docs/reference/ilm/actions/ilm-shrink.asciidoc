[[ilm-shrink]]
=== Shrink

Phases allowed: hot, warm.

Sets an index to <<dynamic-index-settings, read-only>>
and shrinks it into a new index with fewer primary shards.
The name of the new index is of the form `shrink-<original-index-name>`.
For example, if the name of the source index is _logs_,
the name of the shrunken index is _shrink-logs_.

The shrink action allocates all primary shards of the index to one node so it
can call the <<indices-shrink-index,Shrink API>> to shrink the index.
After shrinking, it swaps aliases that point to the original index to the new shrunken index.

To use the `shrink` action in the `hot` phase, the `rollover` action *must* be present.
If no rollover action is configured, {ilm-init} will reject the policy.

[IMPORTANT]
If the shrink action is used on a <<ccr-put-follow,follower index>>,
policy execution waits until the leader index rolls over (or is
<<skipping-rollover, otherwise marked complete>>),
then converts the follower index into a regular index with the
<<ilm-unfollow,unfollow>> action before performing the shrink operation.

If the managed index is part of a <<data-streams, data stream>>,
the shrunken index replaces the original index in the data stream.

[NOTE]
This action cannot be performed on a data stream's write index. Attempts to do
so will fail. To shrink the index, first
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,manually roll over>> the data stream. This
creates a new write index. Because the index is no longer the stream's write
index, the action can resume shrinking it.
Using a policy that makes use of the <<ilm-rollover, rollover>> action
in the hot phase will avoid this situation and the need for a manual rollover for future
managed indices.

[[ilm-shrink-options]]
==== Shrink options
`number_of_shards`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of shards to shrink to.
Must be a factor of the number of shards in the source index. This parameter is conflict with
`max_single_primary_size`, either of them can be set.

`max_single_primary_size`::
(Optional, <<byte-units, byte units>>)
The max single primary shard size of the target index, it's used to find an optimum shards number of the target index.
When this parameter is set properly, each shard's storage of the target index will not be greater than the parameter,
while the shards number of the target index still be a factor of the source index's shards number, but if the parameter
is less than the single shard size of the source index, the shards number of the target index will be equal to the source index's shards number.
For example, when this parameter is set to `50GB`, if the source index has `60` primary shards with `100GB` storage, then the
target index will have `2` primary shards, each shard's storage is `50GB`; if the source index has `60` primary shards
with `1000GB` storage, then the target index will have `20` primary shards; if the source index has `60` primary shards
with `4000GB` storage, then the target index will still have `60` primary shards. This parameter is conflict
with `number_of_shards` in the `settings` parameter, either of them can be set.


[[ilm-shrink-ex]]
==== Example

[[ilm-shrink-shards-ex]]
===== Set the number of shards of the new shrunken index explicitly

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "shrink" : {
            "number_of_shards": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

[[ilm-shrink-size-ex]]
===== Calculate the number of shards of the new shrunken index based on the storage of the
source index and the `max_single_primary_size` parameter

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "shrink" : {
            "max_single_primary_size": "50GB"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

=== Wait for snapshot

Phases allowed: delete.

Waits for the specified {slm-init} policy to be executed before removing the index.
This only checks that an SLM policy has had a successful execution at some point after the wait action has started.
It does not ensure that a snapshot of the index is available before deletion.

[[ilm-wait-for-snapshot-options]]
==== Options

`policy`::
(Required, string)
Name of the {slm-init} policy that the delete action should wait for.

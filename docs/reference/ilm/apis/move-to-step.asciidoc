=== Move to lifecycle step API

Triggers execution of a specific step in the lifecycle policy.

[[ilm-move-to-step-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`POST _ilm/move/<index>`

[[ilm-move-to-step-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage_ilm`
privileges on the indices being managed to use this API. For more information,
see <<security-privileges>>.

[[ilm-move-to-step-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

WARNING: This operation can result in the loss of data. Manually moving an index
into a specific step executes that step even if it has already been performed.
This is a potentially destructive action and this should be considered an expert
level API.

Manually moves an index into the specified step and executes that step.
You must specify both the current step and the step to be executed in the
body of the request.

The request will fail if the current step does not match the step currently
being executed for the index. This is to prevent the index from being moved from
an unexpected step into the next step.

When specifying the target (`next_step`) to which the index will be moved, either the `name` or both
the `action` and `name` fields are optional. If only the phase is specified, the index will move to
the first step of the first action in the target phase. If the phase and action are specified, the index will move to
the first step of the specified action in the specified phase. Only actions specified in the ILM
policy are considered valid, an index cannot move to a step that is not part of its policy.

.Properties of `current_step`

====
`phase`::
(Required, string)
The name of the current phase.
Must match the phase as returned by the <<ilm-explain-lifecycle, explain>> API.

`action`::
(Required, string)
The name of the current action. 
Must match the action as returned by the <<ilm-explain-lifecycle, explain>> API.

`name`::
(Required, string)
The name of the current step. 
Must match the step as returned by the <<ilm-explain-lifecycle, explain>> API.
If {ilm-init} encounters a problem while performing an action, 
it halts execution of the policy and transitions to the `ERROR` step.
If you are trying to advance a policy after troubleshooting a failure, 
you specify this `ERROR` step as the current step.

The following example moves `my-index-000001` from the initial step to the
`forcemerge` step:

<1> The step that the index is expected to be in
<2> The step that you want to execute
<3> The optional action to which the index will be moved

If the request succeeds, you receive the following result:

}

// TEST[continued]

The request will fail if the index is not in the `new` phase as specified
by the `current_step`.

The following example pushes `my-index-000001` from the end of hot phase into
the start of warm:

{
  "current_step": {

  }

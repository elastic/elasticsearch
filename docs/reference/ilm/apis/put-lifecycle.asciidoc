* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage_ilm`
cluster privilege to use this API. You must also have the `manage` index
privilege on all indices being managed by `policy`. All operations executed by
{ilm} for a policy are executed as the user that put the latest version of a
policy. For more information, see <<security-privileges>>.

[[ilm-put-lifecycle-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Creates a lifecycle policy. If the specified policy exists, the policy is
replaced and the policy version is incremented.

NOTE: Only the latest version of the policy is stored, you cannot revert to
previous versions.

PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "10d",
        "actions": {
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

If the request succeeds, you receive the following result:

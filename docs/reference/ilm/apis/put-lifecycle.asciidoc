* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage_ilm`
cluster privilege to use this API. You must also have the `manage` index
privilege on all indices being managed by `policy`. {ilm-init} performs
operations as the user who last updated the policy. {ilm-init} only has the
<<defining-roles,roles>> assigned to the user at the time of the last policy
update.

[[ilm-put-lifecycle-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

replaced and the policy version is incremented.

NOTE: Only the latest version of the policy is stored, you cannot revert to
previous versions.

[[ilm-put-lifecycle-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example creates a new policy named `my_policy`. In addition, you can use the
`_meta` parameter to add arbitrary metadata to the policy, the `_meta` parameter is optional
and not automatically generated or used by Elasticsearch. To unset `_meta`, replace the policy
without specifying one. To check the `_meta`, you can use the <<ilm-get-lifecycle,Get lifecycle policy>> API.

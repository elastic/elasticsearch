Index Modules are modules created per index and control all aspects
related to an index. Since those modules lifecycle are tied to an index,
all the relevant modules settings can be provided when creating an index
(and it is actually the recommended way to configure an index).

== Index Settings

There are specific index level settings that are not associated with any
specific module. These include:

[[index-compound-format]]`index.compound_format`::

	Should the compound file format be used (boolean setting).
	The compound format was created to reduce the number of open
	file handles when using file based storage. However, by default it is set
	to `false` as the non-compound format gives better performance. It is important
	that OS is configured to give Elasticsearch ``enough'' file handles.
    See <<file-descriptors>>.
+
Alternatively, `compound_format` can be set to a number between `0` and
`1`, where `0` means `false`, `1` means `true` and a number inbetween
represents a percentage: if the merged segment is less than this
percentage of the total index, then it is written in compound format,
otherwise it is written in non-compound format.  added[0.90.2]

[[index-compound-on-flush]]`index.compound_on_flush`::

    Should a new segment (create by indexing, not by merging) be written
    in compound format or non-compound format? Defaults to `true`.
    added[0.90.4]. This is a dynamic setting. added[0.90.6,Previously not dynamic]

`index.refresh_interval`::
	A time setting controlling how often the
	refresh operation will be executed. Defaults to `1s`. Can be set to `-1`
	in order to disable it.

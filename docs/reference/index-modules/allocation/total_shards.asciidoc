[[allocation-total-shards]]
=== Total Shards Per Node

The cluster-level shard allocator tries to spread the shards of a single index
across as many nodes as possible.  However, depending on how many shards and
indices you have, and how big they are, it may not always be possible to spread
shards evenly.

The following _dynamic_ setting allows you to specify a hard limit on the total
number of shards from a single index allowed per node:

`index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node`::

    The maximum number of shards (replicas and primaries) that will be
    allocated to a single node.  Defaults to unbounded.

[WARNING]
=======================================
This setting imposes a hard limit which can result in some shards not
being allocated.

Use with caution.

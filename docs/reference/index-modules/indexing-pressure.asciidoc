== Indexing pressure

Indexing documents into {es} introduces system load in the form of memory and
CPU load. Each indexing operation includes coordinating, primary, and replica
stages. These stages can be performed across multiple nodes in a cluster.

Indexing pressure can build up through external operations, such as indexing
requests, or internal mechanisms, such as recoveries and {ccr}. If too much
indexing work is introduced into the system, the cluster can become saturated.
This can adversely impact other operations, such as search, cluster
coordination, and background processing.

To prevent these issues, {es} internally monitors indexing load. When the load
exceeds certain limits, new indexing work is rejected

=== Indexing stages

External indexing operations go through three stages: coordinating, primary, and
replica. See <<basic-write-model>>.

[[memory-limits]]
=== Memory limits

The `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` node setting restricts the number of bytes
available for outstanding indexing requests. This setting defaults to 10% of
the heap.

At the beginning of each indexing stage, {es} accounts for the
bytes consumed by an indexing request. This accounting is only released at the
end of the indexing stage. This means that upstream stages will account for the
request overheard until all downstream stages are complete. For example, the
coordinating request will remain accounted for until primary and replica
stages are complete. The primary request will remain accounted for until each
in-sync replica has responded to enable replica retries if necessary.

A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the coordinating or primary
stage when the number of outstanding coordinating, primary, and replica indexing
bytes exceeds the configured limit.

A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the replica stage when the
number of outstanding replica indexing bytes exceeds 1.5x the configured limit.
This design means that as indexing pressure builds on nodes, they will naturally
stop accepting coordinating and primary work in favor of outstanding replica
work.

The `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` setting's 10% default limit is generously
sized. You should only change it after careful consideration. Only indexing
requests contribute to this limit. This means there is additional indexing
overhead (buffers, listeners, etc) which also require heap space. Other
components of {es} also require memory. Setting this limit too high can deny
operating memory to other operations and components.

`indexing_pressure.memory.limit`::
  Number of outstanding bytes that may be consumed by indexing requests. When
  this limit is reached or exceeded, the node will reject new coordinating and
  primary operations. When replica operations consume 1.5x this limit, the node
  will reject new replica operations. Defaults to 10% of the heap.

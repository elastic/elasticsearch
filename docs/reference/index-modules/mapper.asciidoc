== Mapper

The mapper module acts as a registry for the type mapping definitions
added to an index either when creating it or by using the update mapping
API. It also handles the dynamic mapping support for types that have no
explicit mappings pre defined. For more information about mapping
definitions, check out the <<mapping,mapping section>>.

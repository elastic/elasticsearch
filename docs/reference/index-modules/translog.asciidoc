[[index-modules-translog]]
== Translog

Each shard has a transaction log or write ahead log associated with it.
It allows to guarantee that when an index/delete operation occurs, it is
applied atomically, while not "committing" the internal Lucene index for
each request. A flush ("commit") still happens based on several
parameters:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description
|index.translog.flush_threshold_ops |After how many operations to flush.
Defaults to `unlimited`.

|index.translog.flush_threshold_size |Once the translog hits this size,
a flush will happen. Defaults to `200mb`.

|index.translog.flush_threshold_period |The period with no flush
happening to force a flush. Defaults to `30m`.

|index.translog.interval |How often to check if a flush is needed, randomized
between the interval value and 2x the interval value. Defaults to `5s`.
|=======================================================================

Note: these parameters can be updated at runtime using the Index
Settings Update API (for example, these number can be increased when
executing bulk updates to support higher TPS)

A frozen index has almost no overhead on the cluster (except for maintaining its
metadata in memory) and is read-only. Read-only indices are blocked for write
operations, such as <<indexing,docs-index_>> or <<indices-forcemerge,force
merges>>. See <<frozen-indices>> and <<unfreeze-index-api>>.

The current write index on a data stream cannot be frozen. In order to freeze
the current write index, the data stream must first be
<<rollover-data-stream-ex,rolled over>> so that a new write index is created
and then the previous write index can be frozen.

IMPORTANT: Freezing an index will close the index and reopen it within the same
API call. This causes primaries to not be allocated for a short amount of time
and causes the cluster to go red until the primaries are allocated again. This
limitation might be removed in the future.

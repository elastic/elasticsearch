== Delete Index

The delete index API allows to delete an existing index.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/'
--------------------------------------------------

The above example deletes an index called `twitter`.

The delete index API can also be applied to more than one index, or on
`_all` indices (be careful!). All indices will also be deleted when no
specific index is provided. In order to disable allowing to delete all
indices, set `action.disable_delete_all_indices` setting in the config
to `true`.

[[indices-flush]]
== Flush

The flush process of an index makes sure that any data that is currently only
stored in the <<index-modules-translog,transaction log>> is also permanently
stored in Lucene. When restarting, {es} replays any unflushed operations from
the transaction log into Lucene to ensure that searches do not return stale
results. {es} automatically triggers flushes using heuristics that trade off
the size of the unflushed transaction log against the cost of performing each
flush.

It is also possible to trigger a flush on one or more indices using the flush
API, although it is rare for users to need to call this API directly.

[[flush-parameters]]
=== Request Parameters

The flush API accepts the following request parameters:

[horizontal]
`wait_if_ongoing`::  If set to `true` the flush operation will block until the
flush can be executed if another flush operation is already executing. The
default is `false` and will cause an exception to be thrown on the shard level
if another flush operation is already running.

`force`:: Whether a flush should be forced even if it is not necessarily needed
i.e.  if no changes will be committed to the index. This is useful if
transaction log IDs should be incremented even if no uncommitted changes are
present. (This setting can be considered as internal)

[float]
[[flush-multi-index]]
=== Multi Index

The flush API can be applied to more than one index with a single call, or even
on `_all` the indices.

[[indices-synced-flush]]
=== Synced Flush

{es} keeps track of which shards have received indexing activity recently, and
considers shards that have not received any indexing operations for 5 minutes
to be inactive. When a shard is inactive {es} performs a special kind of flush
known as a _synced flush_. A synced flush performs a normal
<<indices-flush,flush>> on each copy of the shard, and then adds a unique
marker known as the `sync_id` to each copy to indicate that these copies have
identical Lucene indices.

When allocating shard copies, {es} must ensure that each replica contains the
same data as the primary. If the shard copies have been synced-flushed and the
replica shares a `sync_id` with the primary then {es} knows that the two copies
have identical Lucene indices. This means there is no need to copy any segment
files from the primary to the replica, which saves a good deal of time during
recovery or restarts.

This is particularly useful for clusters having lots of indices which are very
rarely updated, such as with time-based indices. Without the synced flush
marker, recovery of this kind of cluster would be much slower.

To check whether a shard has a marker or not, look for the `commit` section of
shard stats returned by the <<indices-stats,indices stats>> API:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
GET twitter/_stats?filter_path=**.commit&level=shards <1>
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[s/^/PUT twitter\nPOST twitter\/_flush\/synced\n/]
<1> `filter_path` is used to reduce the verbosity of the response, but is entirely optional


which returns something similar to:

<1> the `sync id` marker

NOTE: The `sync_id` marker is removed as soon as the shard is flushed again,
and {es} may trigger a flush at any time. In practice this means that one
should consider any indexing operation on an index as having removed the
`sync_id` markers.

=== Synced Flush API

The Synced Flush API allows an administrator to initiate a synced flush
manually. This can be particularly useful for a planned cluster restart where
you can stop indexing but don't want to wait for 5 minutes until all indices
are marked as inactive and automatically sync-flushed.

You can request a synced flush even if there is ongoing indexing activity, and
{es} will perform the synced flush on a "best-effort" basis: shards that do not
have any ongoing indexing activity will be successfully sync-flushed, and other
shards will fail. The successfully sync-flushed shards will have faster
recovery times as long as the `sync_id` marker is not removed by a subsequent
flush.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
POST twitter/_flush/synced
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

The response contains details about how many shards were successfully
sync-flushed and information about any failure.

Here is what it looks like when all shards of a two shards and one replica
index successfully sync-flushed:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "_shards": {
      "total": 2,
      "successful": 2,
      "failed": 0
   },
   "twitter": {
      "total": 2,
      "successful": 2,
      "failed": 0
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"successful": 2/"successful": 1/]

Here is what it looks like when one shard group failed due to pending
operations:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "_shards": {
      "total": 4,
      "successful": 2,
      "failed": 2
   },
   "twitter": {
      "total": 4,
      "successful": 2,
      "failed": 2,
      "failures": [
         {
            "shard": 1,
            "reason": "[2] ongoing operations on primary"
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

NOTE: The above error is shown when the synced flush fails due to concurrent
indexing operations. The HTTP status code in that case will be `409 Conflict`.

Sometimes the failures are specific to a shard copy. The copies that failed
will not be eligible for fast recovery but those that succeeded still will be.
This case is reported as follows:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   "_shards": {
      "total": 4,
      "successful": 1,
      "failed": 1
   },
   "twitter": {
      "total": 4,
      "successful": 3,
      "failed": 1,
      "failures": [
         {
            "shard": 1,
            "reason": "unexpected error",
            "routing": {
               "state": "STARTED",
               "primary": false,
               "node": "SZNr2J_ORxKTLUCydGX4zA",
               "relocating_node": null,
               "shard": 1,
               "index": "twitter"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

NOTE: When a shard copy fails to sync-flush, the HTTP status code returned will
be `409 Conflict`.

The synced flush API can be applied to more than one index with a single call,
or even on `_all` the indices.

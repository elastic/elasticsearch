== Index management in {kib}

{kib}'s *Index Management* features are an easy, convenient way to manage your
cluster's indices, <<data-streams,data streams>>, <<index-templates,index
templates>>, and <<ingest-enriching-data,enrich policies>>. Practicing good index management ensures your data is stored
correctly and in the most cost-effective way possible.

To use these features, go to *Stack Management* > *Index Management*.

[[index-mgm-req-permissions]]
=== Required permissions

If you use {es} {security-features}, the following
<<security-privileges,security privileges>> are required:

* The `monitor` cluster privilege to access {kib}'s *Index Management* features.
* The `view_index_metadata` and `manage` index privileges to view a data stream
or index's data.
* The `manage_index_templates` cluster privilege to manage index templates.

To add these privileges, go to *Stack Management > Security > Roles* or use the <<security-api-put-role,Create or update roles API>>.

[[view-edit-indices]]
=== Manage indices

Investigate your indices and perform operations from the *Indices* view.

[role="screenshot"]

* To show details and perform operations such as close, forcemerge, and flush,
click the index name.  To perform operations
on multiple indices, select their checkboxes and then open the *Manage* menu.
For more information on managing indices, refer to <<indices, Index APIs>>.

* To filter the list of indices, use the search bar or click a badge.
Badges indicate if an index is a <<ccr-put-follow,follower index>>, a
<<rollup-get-rollup-index-caps,rollup index>>, or <<unfreeze-index-api,frozen>>.

* To drill down into the index
<<mapping,mappings>>, <<index-modules-settings,settings>>, and statistics,
click an index name. From this view, you can navigate to *Discover* to
further explore the documents in the index.

[[manage-data-streams]]
=== Manage data streams

Investigate your data streams and address lifecycle management needs in the *Data Streams* view.

The value in the *Indices* column indicates the number of backing indices. Click this number to drill down into details.

A value in the data retention column indicates that the data stream is managed by a <<data-stream-lifecycle,data stream lifecycle policy>>.
This value is the time period for which your data is guaranteed to be stored. Data older than this period can be deleted by
Elasticsearch at a later time.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/index-mgmt/management-data-stream.png[Data stream details]

* To view more information about a data stream, such as its generation or its
current index lifecycle policy, click the stream's name. From this view, you can navigate to *Discover* to
further explore data within the data stream.

* preview:[]To edit the data retention value, open the *Manage* menu, and then click *Edit data retention*.
This action is only available if your data stream is not managed by an ILM policy.

[[manage-index-templates]]
=== Manage index templates

Create,
edit, clone, and delete your index templates in the *Index Templates* view. Changes made to an index template do not
affect existing indices.

==== Try it: Create an index template

In this tutorial, you’ll create an index template and use it to configure two
new indices.

*Step 1. Add a name and index pattern*

. In the *Index Templates* view, open the *Create template* wizard.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/index-mgmt/management_index_create_wizard.png[Create wizard]

. In the *Name* field, enter `my-index-template`.

. Set *Index pattern* to `my-index-*` so the template matches any index
with that index pattern.

. Leave *Data Stream*, *Priority*, *Version*, and *_meta field* blank or as-is.

*Step 2. Add settings, mappings, and aliases*

. Add <<indices-component-template,component templates>> to your index template.
+
Component templates are pre-configured sets of mappings, index settings, and
aliases you can reuse across multiple index templates. Badges indicate
whether a component template contains mappings (*M*), index settings (*S*),
aliases (*A*), or a combination of the three.
+
Component templates are optional. For this tutorial, do not add any component
templates.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/index-mgmt/management_index_component_template.png[Component templates page]

. Define index settings. These are optional. For this tutorial, leave this
section blank.

. Define a mapping that contains an <<object,object>> field named `geo` with a
child <<geo-point,`geo_point`>> field named `coordinates`:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/index-mgmt/management-index-templates-mappings.png[Mapped fields page]
+
Alternatively, you can click the *Load JSON* link and define the mapping as JSON:
+
[source,js]
----
{
  "properties": {
    "geo": {
      "properties": {
        "coordinates": {
          "type": "geo_point"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE
+
You can create additional mapping configurations in the *Dynamic templates* and
*Advanced options* tabs. For this tutorial, do not create any additional
mappings.

. Define an alias named `my-index`:
+
[source,js]
----
{
  "my-index": {}
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

. On the review page, check the summary. If everything looks right, click
*Create template*.

*Step 3. Create new indices*

You’re now ready to create new indices using your index template.

. Index the following documents to create two indices:
`my-index-000001` and `my-index-000002`.
+
[source,console]
----
POST /my-index-000001/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-05-18T15:57:27.541Z",
  "ip": "225.44.217.191",
  "extension": "jpg",
  "response": "200",
  "geo": {
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 38.53146222,
      "lon": -121.7864906
    }
  },
  "url": "https://media-for-the-masses.theacademyofperformingartsandscience.org/uploads/charles-fullerton.jpg"
}

POST /my-index-000002/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-05-20T03:44:20.844Z",
  "ip": "198.247.165.49",
  "extension": "php",
  "response": "200",
  "geo": {
    "coordinates": {
      "lat": 37.13189556,
      "lon": -76.4929875
    }
  },
  "memory": 241720,
  "url": "https://theacademyofperformingartsandscience.org/people/type:astronauts/name:laurel-b-clark/profile"
}
----

. Use the <<indices-get-index,get index API>> to view the configurations for the
new indices. The indices were configured using the index template you created
earlier.

[[manage-enrich-policies]]
=== Manage enrich policies

Use the *Enrich Policies* view to add data from your existing indices to incoming documents during ingest.
An enrich policy contains:

* The policy type that determines how the policy matches the enrich data to incoming documents
* The source indices that store enrich data as documents
* The fields from the source indices used to match incoming documents
* The enrich fields containing enrich data from the source indices that you want to add to incoming documents
* An optional <<query-dsl-match-all-query,query>>.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/index-mgmt/management-enrich-policies.png[Enrich policies]


When creating an enrich policy, the UI walks you through the configuration setup and selecting the fields.
Before you can use the policy with an enrich processor or {esql} query, you must execute the policy.

When executed, an enrich policy uses enrich data from the policy’s source indices
to create a streamlined system index called the enrich index. The policy uses this index to match and enrich incoming documents.

Check out these examples:

* <<geo-match-enrich-policy-type>>
* <<match-enrich-policy-type>>
* <<range-enrich-policy-type>>

== Open / Close Index API

The open and close index APIs allow to close an index, and later on
opening it. A closed index has almost no overhead on the cluster (except
for maintaining its metadata), and is blocked for read/write operations.
A closed index can be opened which will then go through the normal
recovery process.

The REST endpoint is `/{index}/_close` and `/{index}/_open`. For
example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/my_index/_close'

curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/my_index/_open'
--------------------------------------------------

== Reload Search Analyzers

experimental[]

Reloads search analyzers and its resources.

The `_reload_search_analyzers` API can be run on one or more indices and will
reload all search analyzers that contain components that were marked as
updateable when they were created, such as 
<<analysis-synonym-tokenfilter,synonym token filters>>:

[source,js]

PUT /my_index
{
    "settings": {
        "index" : {
            "analysis" : {
                "analyzer" : {
                    "my_synonyms" : {
                        "tokenizer" : "whitespace",
                        "filter" : ["synonym"]
                    }
                },
                "filter" : {
                    "synonym" : {
                        "type" : "synonym",
                        "synonyms_path" : "analysis/synonym.txt",
                        "updateable" : true <1>
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "text": {
                "type": "text",
                "analyzer" : "standard",
                "search_analyzer": "my_synonyms" <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

<1> Mark the synonym filter as updateable.
<2> Synonym analyzer is usable as a search_analyzer.

Calling the `_reload_search_analyzers` endpoint will now trigger reloading of the
synonyms from the configured "synonym.txt" file.

NOTE: Reloading will happen on every node the index has shards, so its important
to update the synonym file contents on every data node (even the ones that don't currently
hold shard copies; shards might be relocated there in the future) before calling
reload to ensure the new state of the file is reflected everywhere in the cluster.

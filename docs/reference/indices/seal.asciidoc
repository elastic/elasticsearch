[[indices-seal]]
== Seal

The seal API allows to flush one or more indices and adds a marker to primaries and replicas if there are no pending write operations.
The seal marker is used during recovery after a node restarts. If a replica is allocated on a node which already has a shard copy with the same seal as the primary then no files will be copied during recovery.
Sealing is a best effort operation. If write operations are ongoing while the sealing is in progress then writing the seal might fail on some copies.

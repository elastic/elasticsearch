[[indices-seal]]
== Seal

The seal API allows to flush one or more indices and adds a marker to
primaries and replicas if there are no pending write operations. The seal
marker is used during recovery after a node restarts. If a replica is
allocated on a node which already has a shard copy with the same seal as the
primary then no files will be copied during recovery. Sealing is a best effort
operation. If write operations are ongoing while the sealing is in progress
then writing the seal might fail on some copies.

A seal marks a point in time snapshot (a low level Lucene commit). This mark
can be used to decide if the initial, rather resource heavy, recovery phase
where segments or event the entire lucene index is copied over the network can
be skipped. If the indices on both sides of the recovery have the same seal no
segment files need to be copied and transaction log replay can start
immediately. The seal breaks as soon as the shard issues a new lucene commit,
uncommitted operations in the transaction log do not break the seal until they
are committed.

the reason in case of failure.

=== Multi Index

The seal API can be applied to more than one index with a single call,
or even on `_all` the indices.

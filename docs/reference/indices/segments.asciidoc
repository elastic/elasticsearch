[[indices-segments]]
== Indices Segments

Provide low level segments information that a Lucene index (shard level)
is built with. Allows to be used to provide more information on the
state of a shard and an index, possibly optimization information, data
"wasted" on deletes, and so on.

Endpoints include segments for a specific index, several indices, or
all:

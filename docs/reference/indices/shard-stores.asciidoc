== Indices Shard Stores

Provides store information for shard copies of indices.
Store information reports on which nodes shard copies exist, the shard
copy allocation ID, a unique identifier for each shard copy, and any exceptions
encountered while opening the shard index or from earlier engine failure.

By default, only lists store information for shards that have at least one
unallocated copy. When the cluster health status is yellow, this will list
store information for shards that have at least one unassigned replica.
When the cluster health status is red, this will list store information
for shards, which has unassigned primaries.

Endpoints include shard stores information for a specific index, several
indices, or all:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test/_shard_stores'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/test1,test2/_shard_stores'
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_shard_stores'
--------------------------------------------------

The scope of shards to list store information can be changed through
`status` param. Defaults to 'yellow' and 'red'. 'yellow' lists store information of
shards with at least one unassigned replica and 'red' for shards with unassigned
primary shard.
Use 'green' to list store information for shards with all assigned copies.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_shard_stores?status=green'
--------------------------------------------------

Response:

The shard stores information is grouped by indices and shard ids.

<1> The key is the corresponding shard id for the store information
<2> A list of store information for all copies of the shard
<3> The node information that hosts a copy of the store, the key
    is the unique node id.
<4> The allocation id of the store copy
<5> The version of the store copy (available only for legacy shard copies that have
    not yet been active in a current version of Elasticsearch)
<6> The status of the store copy, whether it is used as a
    primary, replica or not used at all
<7> Any exception encountered while opening the shard index or
    from earlier engine failure

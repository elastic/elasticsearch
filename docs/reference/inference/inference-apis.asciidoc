== {infer-cap} APIs

experimental[]

IMPORTANT: The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in
{ml} models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Azure, Google AI Studio or
Hugging Face. For built-in models and models uploaded through Eland, the {infer}
APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained models. However, if you
do not plan to use the {infer} APIs to use these models or if you want to use
non-NLP models, use the <<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

The {infer} APIs enable you to create {infer} endpoints and use {ml} models of
different providers - such as Cohere, OpenAI, or HuggingFace - as a service. Use
the following APIs to manage {infer} models and perform {infer}:

* <<delete-inference-api>>
* <<get-inference-api>>
* <<post-inference-api>>
* <<put-inference-api>>

== {infer-cap} APIs

experimental[]

IMPORTANT: The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in
{ml} models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Azure,
Google AI Studio or Hugging Face. For built-in models and models uploaded
through Eland, the {infer} APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage
trained models. However, if you do not plan to use the {infer} APIs to use these
models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the
<<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

The {infer} APIs enable you to create {infer} endpoints and use {ml} models of
different providers - such as Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Azure AI Studio,
Cohere, Google AI, Mistral, OpenAI, or HuggingFace - as a service. Use
the following APIs to manage {infer} models and perform {infer}:

* <<delete-inference-api>>
* <<get-inference-api>>
* <<post-inference-api>>
* <<put-inference-api>>

An {infer} endpoint enables you to use the corresponding {ml} model without
manual deployment and apply it to your data at ingestion time through
<<semantic-search-semantic-text, semantic text>>. 

Choose a model from your provider or use ELSER – a retrieval model trained by 
Elastic –, then create an {infer} endpoint by the <<put-inference-api>>.
Now use <<semantic-search-semantic-text, semantic text>> to perform
<<semantic-search, semantic search>> on your data.

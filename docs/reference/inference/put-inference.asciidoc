=== Create {infer} API

experimental[]

Creates a model to perform an {infer} task.

IMPORTANT: The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in
{ml} models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, or
Hugging Face. For built-in models and models uploaded though
Eland, the {infer} APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained
models. However, if you do not plan to use the {infer} APIs to use these models
or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the <<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

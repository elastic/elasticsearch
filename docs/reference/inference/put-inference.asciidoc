=== Create {infer} API

experimental[]

Creates an {infer} endpoint to perform an {infer} task.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in
{ml} models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Mistral,
Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic or Hugging Face.
* For built-in models and models uploaded through Eland, the {infer} APIs offer an
alternative way to use and manage trained models. However, if you do not plan to
use the {infer} APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models,
use the <<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

The create {infer} API enables you to create an {infer} endpoint and configure a {ml} model to perform a specific {infer} task.

The following services are available through the {infer} API, click the links to review the configuration details of the services:

* <<infer-service-amazon-bedrock,Amazon Bedrock>>
* <<infer-service-anthropic,Anthropic>>
* <<infer-service-azure-ai-studio,Azure AI Studio>>
* <<infer-service-azure-openai,Azure OpenAI>>
* <<infer-service-cohere,Cohere>>
* <<infer-service-elasticsearch,Elasticsearch>> (for built-in models and models uploaded through Eland)
* <<infer-service-elser,ELSER>>
* <<infer-service-google-ai-studio,Google AI Studio>>
* <<infer-service-google-vertex-ai,Google Vertex AI>>
* <<infer-service-hugging-face,Hugging Face>>
* <<infer-service-mistral,Mistral>>
* <<infer-service-openai,OpenAI>>

The {es} and ELSER services run on a {ml} node in your {es} cluster. The rest of
the services connect to external providers.

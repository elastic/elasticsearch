=== Create {infer} API

experimental[]

Creates an {infer} endpoint to perform an {infer} task.

IMPORTANT: The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in
{ml} models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio or Hugging Face.
For built-in models and models uploaded though Eland, the {infer} APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained models.
However, if you do not plan to use the {infer} APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the
<<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

`api_key`:::
(Required, string)
A valid API key of your Azure AI Studio model deployment.
This key can be found on the overview page for your deployment in the management section of your https://ai.azure.com/[Azure AI Studio] account.

IMPORTANT: You need to provide the API key only once, during the {infer} model creation.
The <<get-inference-api>> does not retrieve your API key.
After creating the {infer} model, you cannot change the associated API key.
If you want to use a different API key, delete the {infer} model and recreate it with the same name and the updated API key.

`target`:::
(Required, string)
The target URL of your Azure AI Studio model deployment.
This can be found on the overview page for your deployment in the management section of your https://ai.azure.com/[Azure AI Studio] account.

`provider`:::
(Required, string)
The model provider for your deployment.
Note that some providers may support only certain task types.
Supported providers include:

* `cohere` - available for `text_embedding` and `completion` task types
* `databricks` - available for `completion` task type only
* `meta` - available for `completion` task type only
* `microsoft_phi` - available for `completion` task type only
* `mistral` - available for `completion` task type only
* `openai` - available for `text_embedding` and `completion` task types

`endpoint_type`:::
(Required, string)
One of `token` or `realtime`.
Specifies the type of endpoint that is used in your model deployment.
There are https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/deployments-overview#billing-for-deploying-and-inferencing-llms-in-azure-ai-studio[two endpoint types available] for deployment through Azure AI Studio.
"Pay as you go" endpoints are billed per token.
For these, you must specify `token` for your `endpoint_type`.
For "real-time" endpoints which are billed per hour of usage, specify `realtime`.

`rate_limit`:::
(Optional, object)
By default, the `azureaistudio` service sets the number of requests allowed per minute to `240`.
This helps to minimize the number of rate limit errors returned from Azure AI Studio.
To modify this, set the `requests_per_minute` setting of this object in your service settings:

`api_key` or `entra_id`:::
(Required, string)
You must provide _either_ an API key or an Entra ID.
If you do not provide either, or provide both, you will receive an error when trying to create your model.
See the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#authentication[Azure OpenAI Authentication documentation] for more details on these authentication types.

IMPORTANT: You need to provide the API key or Entra ID only once, during the {infer} model creation.
The <<get-inference-api>> does not retrieve your authentication credentials.
After creating the {infer} model, you cannot change the associated API key or Entra ID.
If you want to use a different API key or Entra ID, delete the {infer} model and recreate it with the same name and the updated API key.
You _must_ have either an `api_key` or an `entra_id` defined.
If neither are present, an error will occur.

`resource_name`:::
(Required, string)

You can find this from the https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseAll[list of resources] in the Azure Portal for your subscription.

We recommend using the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#embeddings[latest supported non-preview version].

`rate_limit`:::
(Optional, object)
The `azureopenai` service sets a default number of requests allowed per minute depending on the task type.
For `text_embedding` it is set to `1440`.
For `completion` it is set to `120`.
This helps to minimize the number of rate limit errors returned from Azure.

`text_embedding` is `embed-english-v2.0`.

`rate_limit`:::
(Optional, object)
By default, the `cohere` service sets the number of requests allowed per minute to `10000`.

<2> The {infer} endpoint URL you created on Hugging Face.

Create a new {infer} endpoint on
https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/[the Hugging Face endpoint page] to get an endpoint URL.
Select the model you want to use on the new endpoint creation page - for example `intfloat/e5-small-v2` - then select the `Sentence Embeddings`
task under the Advanced configuration section.
Create the endpoint.
Copy the URL after the endpoint initialization has been finished.

===== Models uploaded by Eland via the elasticsearch service

The following example shows how to create an {infer} endpoint called
`my-msmarco-minilm-model` to perform a `text_embedding` task type.

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
PUT _inference/text_embedding/my-msmarco-minilm-model
{
  "service": "elasticsearch",
  "service_settings": {
    "num_allocations": 1,
    "num_threads": 1,
    "model_id": "msmarco-MiniLM-L12-cos-v5" <1>
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The `model_id` must be the ID of a text embedding model which has already been
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-import-model.html#ml-nlp-import-script[uploaded through Eland].

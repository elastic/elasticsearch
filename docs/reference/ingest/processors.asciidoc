== Ingest processor reference

<titleabbrev>Processor reference</titleabbrev>
++++

An <<ingest,ingest pipeline>> is made up of a sequence of processors that are applied to documents as they are ingested into an index.
Each processor performs a specific task, such as filtering, transforming, or enriching data.

Each successive processor depends on the output of the previous processor, so the order of processors is important.
The modified documents are indexed into {es} after all processors are applied.

{es} includes over 40 configurable processors.
The subpages in this section contain reference documentation for each processor.
To get a list of available
processors, use the <<cluster-nodes-info,nodes info>> API.

Normalizes non-OpenTelemetry documents to be OpenTelemetry-compliant.

<<registered-domain-processor, `registered_domain` processor>>::
Extracts the registered domain (also known as the effective top-level domain or eTLD), sub-domain, and top-level domain from a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

<<ingest-node-set-security-user-processor, `set_security_user` processor>>::
Sets user-related details (such as `username`,  `roles`, `email`, `full_name`,`metadata`, `api_key`, `realm` and `authentication_type`) from the current authenticated user.

<<uri-parts-processor, `uri_parts` processor>>::
Parses a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) string and extracts its components as an object.

<<urldecode-processor, `urldecode` processor>>::
URL-decodes a string.

<<user-agent-processor, `user_agent` processor>>::

[discrete]
[[ingest-process-category-data-transformation]]
=== Data transformation processors

[discrete]
[[ingest-process-category-data-transformation-general]]
==== General outcomes

<<convert-processor, `convert` processor>>::
Converts a field in the currently ingested document to a different type, such as converting a string to an integer.

<<dissect-processor, `dissect` processor>>::
Extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document.
Unlike the <<grok-processor,grok processor>>, dissect does not use regular expressions.
This makes the dissect's a simpler and often faster alternative.

<<grok-processor, `grok` processor>>::
Extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document, using the <<grok, Grok>> regular expression dialect that supports reusable aliased expressions.

<<gsub-processor, `gsub` processor>>::
Converts a string field by applying a regular expression and a replacement.

<<redact-processor, `redact` processor>>::
Uses the <<grok, Grok>> rules engine to obscure text in the input document matching the given Grok patterns.

<<rename-processor, `rename` processor>>::
Renames an existing field.

<<set-processor, `set` processor>>::
Sets a value on a field.

[discrete]
[[ingest-process-category-data-transformation-specific]]
==== Specific outcomes

<<bytes-processor, `bytes` processor>>::
Converts a human-readable byte value to its value in bytes (for example `1kb` becomes `1024`).

<<csv-processor, `csv` processor>>::
Extracts a single line of CSV data from a text field.

<<date-processor, `date` processor>>::
Extracts and converts date fields.

<<dot-expand-processor, `dot_expand` processor>>::
Expands a field with dots into an object field.

<<htmlstrip-processor, `html_strip` processor>>::
Removes HTML tags from a field.

<<join-processor, `join` processor>>::
Joins each element of an array into a single string using a separator character between each element.

<<kv-processor, `kv` processor>>::
Parse messages (or specific event fields) containing key-value pairs.

<<lowercase-processor, `lowercase` processor>> and <<uppercase-processor, `uppercase` processor>>::
Converts a string field to lowercase or uppercase.

<<split-processor, `split` processor>>::
Splits a field into an array of values.

<<trim-processor, `trim` processor>>::
Trims whitespace from field. 

[discrete]

<<pipeline-processor, `pipeline` processor>>::
Executes another pipeline.

<<reroute-processor, `reroute` processor>>::
Reroutes documents to another target index or data stream.

<<terminate-processor, `terminate` processor>>::

<<json-processor, `json` processor>>::
Converts a JSON string into a structured JSON object.

<<script-processor, `script` processor>>::
Runs an inline or stored <<modules-scripting, script>> on incoming documents.
The script runs in the {painless}/painless-ingest-processor-context.html[painless `ingest` context].

<<sort-processor, `sort` processor>>::
Sorts the elements of an array in ascending or descending order.

[discrete]
[[ingest-process-plugins]]
=== Add additional processors

You can install additional processors as {plugins}/ingest.html[plugins].

You must install any plugin processors on all nodes in your cluster. Otherwise,
{es} will fail to create pipelines containing the processor.

Mark a plugin as mandatory by setting `plugin.mandatory` in
`elasticsearch.yml`. A node will fail to start if a mandatory plugin is not
installed.

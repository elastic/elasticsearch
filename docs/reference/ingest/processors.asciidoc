{es} includes several configurable processors. To get a list of available
processors, use the <<cluster-nodes-info,nodes info>> API.

=== Processor plugins

You can install additional processors as {plugins}/ingest.html[plugins].

You must install any plugin processors on all nodes in your cluster. Otherwise,
{es} will fail to create pipelines containing the processor.

Mark a plugin as mandatory by setting `plugin.mandatory` in
`elasticsearch.yml`. A node will fail to start if a mandatory plugin is not
installed.

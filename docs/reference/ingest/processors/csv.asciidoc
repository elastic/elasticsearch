If the `trim` option is enabled then any whitespace in the beginning and in the end of each unquoted field will be trimmed.
For example with configuration above, a value of `A, B` will result in field `field2`
having value `{nbsp}B` (with space at the beginning). If `trim` is enabled `A, B` will result in field `field2`
having value `B` (no whitespace). Quoted fields will be left untouched.

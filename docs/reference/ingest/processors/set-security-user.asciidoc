=== Set security user processor

<titleabbrev>Set security user</titleabbrev>

Sets user-related details (such as `username`, `roles`, `email`, `full_name`,
`metadata`, `api_key`, `realm` and `authentication_type`) from the current
authenticated user.
The `api_key` property exists only if the user authenticates with an
API key. It is an object containing the `id`, `name` and `metadata`
(if it exists and is non-empty) fields of the API key.
The `realm` property is also an object with two fields, `name` and `type`.
When using API key authentication, the `realm` property refers to the realm
from which the API key is created.
The `authentication_type` property is a string that can take value from
`REALM`, `API_KEY`, `TOKEN` and `ANONYMOUS`.

IMPORTANT: Requires an authenticated user for the index request.

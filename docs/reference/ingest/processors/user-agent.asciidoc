The `user_agent` processor extracts details from the user agent string a browser sends with its web requests.
This processor adds this information by default under the `user_agent` field.

The ingest-user-agent module ships by default with the regexes.yaml made available by uap-java with an Apache 2.0 license. For more details see https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core.

Here is an example that adds the user agent details to the `user_agent` field based on the `agent` field:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ingest/pipeline/user_agent
{
  "description" : "Add user agent information",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "user_agent" : {
        "field" : "agent"
      }
    }
  ]
}
PUT my-index-000001/_doc/my_id?pipeline=user_agent
{
  "agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36"
}
GET my-index-000001/_doc/my_id
--------------------------------------------------

Which returns

===== Using a custom regex file
To use a custom regex file for parsing the user agents, that file has to be put into the `config/ingest-user-agent` directory and
has to have a `.yml` filename extension. The file has to be present at node startup, any changes to it or any new files added
while the node is running will not have any effect.

In practice, it will make most sense for any custom regex file to be a variant of the default file, either a more recent version
or a customised version.

The default file included in `ingest-user-agent` is the `regexes.yaml` from uap-core: https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/blob/master/regexes.yaml

[[ingest-user-agent-settings]]
===== Node Settings

The `user_agent` processor supports the following setting:

`ingest.user_agent.cache_size`::

    The maximum number of results that should be cached. Defaults to `1000`.

Note that these settings are node settings and apply to all `user_agent` processors, i.e. there is one cache for all defined `user_agent` processors.

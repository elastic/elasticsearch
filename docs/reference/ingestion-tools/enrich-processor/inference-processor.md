# {{infer-cap}} processor [inference-processor]

Uses a pre-trained {{dfanalytics}} model or a model deployed for natural language processing tasks to infer against the data that is being ingested in the pipeline.

$$$inference-options$$$

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model_id`  | yes | - | (String) An inference ID, a model deployment ID, a trained model ID or an alias. |
| `input_output` | no | - | (List) Input fields for {{infer}} and output (destination) fields for the {{infer}} results. This option is incompatible with the `target_field` and `field_map` options. |
| `target_field` | no | `ml.inference.<processor_tag>` | (String) Field added to incoming documents to contain results objects. |
| `field_map` | no | If defined the model’s default field map | (Object) Maps the document field names to the known field names of the model. This mapping takes precedence over any default mappings provided in the model configuration. |
| `inference_config` | no | The default settings defined in the model | (Object) Contains the inference type and its options. |
| `ignore_missing` | no | `false` | (Boolean) If `true` and any of the input fields defined in `input_ouput` are missing then those missing fields are quietly ignored, otherwise a missing field causes a failure. Only applies when using `input_output` configurations to explicitly list the input fields. |
| `description` | no | - | Description of the processor. Useful for describing the purpose of the processor or its configuration. |
| `if` | no | - | Conditionally execute the processor. See [Conditionally run a processor](docs-content://manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md#conditionally-run-processor). |
| `ignore_failure` | no | `false` | Ignore failures for the processor. See [Handling pipeline failures](docs-content://manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md#handling-pipeline-failures). |
| `on_failure` | no | - | Handle failures for the processor. See [Handling pipeline failures](docs-content://manage-data/ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md#handling-pipeline-failures). |
| `tag` | no | - | Identifier for the processor. Useful for debugging and metrics. |

::::{important}

* You cannot use the `input_output` field with the `target_field` and `field_map` fields. For NLP models, use the `input_output` option. For {{dfanalytics}} models, use the `target_field` and `field_map` option.
* Each {{infer}} input field must be single strings, not arrays of strings.
* The `input_field` is processed as is and ignores any [index mapping](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping.md)'s [analyzers](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/text-analysis.md) at time of {{infer}} run.

## Configuring input and output fields [inference-input-output-example]

Select the `content` field for inference and write the result to `content_embedding`.

::::{important}
If the specified `output_field` already exists in the ingest document, it won’t be overwritten. The {{infer}} results will be appended to the existing fields within `output_field`, which could lead to duplicate fields and potential errors. To avoid this, use an unique `output_field` field name that does not clash with any existing fields.
::::


```js
{
  "inference": {
    "model_id": "model_deployment_for_inference",
    "input_output": [
        {
            "input_field": "content",
            "output_field": "content_embedding"
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuring multiple inputs [_configuring_multiple_inputs]

The `content` and `title` fields will be read from the incoming document and sent to the model for the inference. The inference output is written to `content_embedding` and `title_embedding` respectively.

```js
{
  "inference": {
    "model_id": "model_deployment_for_inference",
    "input_output": [
        {
            "input_field": "content",
            "output_field": "content_embedding"
        },
        {
            "input_field": "title",
            "output_field": "title_embedding"
        }
    ]
  }
}
```

Selecting the input fields with `input_output` is incompatible with the `target_field` and `field_map` options.

{{dfanalytics-cap}} models must use the `target_field` to specify the root location results are written to and optionally a `field_map` to map field names in the input document to the model input fields.

```js
{
  "inference": {
    "model_id": "model_deployment_for_inference",
    "target_field": "FlightDelayMin_prediction_infer",
    "field_map": {
      "your_field": "my_field"
    },
    "inference_config": { "regression": {} }
  }
}
```

## Text similarity configuration options [inference-processor-text-similarity-opt]

`text_similarity`
:   (Object, optional) Text similarity takes an input sequence and compares it with another input sequence. This is commonly referred to as cross-encoding. This task is useful for ranking document text when comparing it to another provided text input.

    ::::{dropdown} Properties of text_similarity inference
    `span_score_combination_function`
    :   (Optional, string) Identifies how to combine the resulting similarity score when a provided text passage is longer than `max_sequence_length` and must be automatically separated for multiple calls. This only is applicable when `truncate` is `none` and `span` is a non-negative number. The default value is `max`. Available options are:
        * `max`: The maximum score from all the spans is returned.
        * `mean`: The mean score over all the spans is returned.
    `tokenization`
    :   (Optional, object) Indicates the tokenization to perform and the desired settings. The default tokenization configuration is `bert`. Valid tokenization values are
        * `bert`: Use for BERT-style models
        * `deberta_v2`: Use for DeBERTa v2 and v3-style models
        * `mpnet`: Use for MPNet-style models

## {{infer-cap}} processor examples [inference-processor-config-example]

```js
"inference":{
  "model_id": "my_model_id",
  "field_map": {
    "original_fieldname": "expected_fieldname"
  },
  "inference_config": {
    "regression": {
      "results_field": "my_regression"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies a `regression` inference and the results are written to the `my_regression` field contained in the `target_field` results object. The `field_map` configuration maps the field `original_fieldname` from the source document to the field expected by the model.

```js
"inference":{
  "model_id":"my_model_id"
  "inference_config": {
    "classification": {
      "num_top_classes": 2,
      "results_field": "prediction",
      "top_classes_results_field": "probabilities"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies a `classification` inference. The number of categories for which the predicted probabilities are reported is 2 (`num_top_classes`). The result is written to the `prediction` field and the top classes to the `probabilities` field. Both fields are contained in the `target_field` results object.

For an example that uses {{nlp}} trained models, refer to [Add NLP inference to ingest pipelines](docs-content://explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-inference.md).


### {{feat-imp-cap}} object mapping [inference-processor-feature-importance]

To get the full benefit of aggregating and searching for [{{feat-imp}}](docs-content://explore-analyze/machine-learning/data-frame-analytics/ml-feature-importance.md), update your index mapping of the {{feat-imp}} result field as you can see below:

```js
"ml.inference.feature_importance": {
  "type": "nested",
  "dynamic": true,
  "properties": {
    "feature_name": {
      "type": "keyword"
    },
    "importance": {
      "type": "double"
    }
  }
}
```

The mapping field name for {{feat-imp}} (in the example above, it is `ml.inference.feature_importance`) is compounded as follows:

`<ml.inference.target_field>`.`<inference.tag>`.`feature_importance`

* `<ml.inference.target_field>`: defaults to `ml.inference`.
* `<inference.tag>`: if is not provided in the processor definition, then it is not part of the field path.

For example, if you provide a tag `foo` in the definition as you can see below:

```js
{
  "tag": "foo",
  ...
}
```

Then, the {{feat-imp}} value is written to the `ml.inference.foo.feature_importance` field.

You can also specify the target field as follows:

```js
{
  "tag": "foo",
  "target_field": "my_field"
}
```

In this case, {{feat-imp}} is exposed in the `my_field.foo.feature_importance` field.


### {{infer-cap}} processor examples [inference-processor-examples]

The following example uses an [{{infer}} endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-inference) in an {{infer}} processor named `query_helper_pipeline` to perform a chat completion task. The processor generates an {{es}} query from natural language input using a prompt designed for a completion task type. Refer to [this list](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-inference-put) for the {{infer}} service you use and check the corresponding examples of setting up an endpoint with the chat completion task type.

```console
PUT _ingest/pipeline/query_helper_pipeline
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "script": {
        "source": "ctx.prompt = 'Please generate an elasticsearch search query on index `articles_index` for the following natural language query. Dates are in the field `@timestamp`, document types are in the field `type` (options are `news`, `publication`), categories in the field `category` and can be multiple (options are `medicine`, `pharmaceuticals`, `technology`), and document names are in the field `title` which should use a fuzzy match. Ignore fields which cannot be determined from the natural language query context: ' + ctx.content" <1>
      }
    },
    {
      "inference": {
        "model_id": "openai_chat_completions", <2>
        "input_output": {
          "input_field": "prompt",
          "output_field": "query"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "remove": {
        "field": "prompt"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

1. The `prompt` field contains the prompt used for the completion task, created with [Painless](docs-content://explore-analyze/scripting/modules-scripting-painless.md). `+ ctx.content` appends the natural language input to the prompt.
2. The ID of the pre-configured {{infer}} endpoint, which utilizes the [`openai` service](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-inference-put) with the `completion` task type.


The following API request will simulate running a document through the ingest pipeline created previously:

```console
POST _ingest/pipeline/query_helper_pipeline/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_source": {
        "content": "artificial intelligence in medicine articles published in the last 12 months" <1>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

1. The natural language query used to generate an {{es}} query within the prompt created by the {{infer}} processor.

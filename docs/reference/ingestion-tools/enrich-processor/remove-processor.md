Here is an example to remove a single field:

```js
{
  "remove": {
    "field": "user_agent"
  }
}
```

To remove multiple fields, you can use the following query:

```js
{
  "remove": {
    "field": ["user_agent", "url"]
  }
}
```

You can also choose to remove all fields other than a specified list:

```js
{
  "remove": {
    "keep": ["url"]
  }
}
```

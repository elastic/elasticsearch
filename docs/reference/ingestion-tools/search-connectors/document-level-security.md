# Document level security [es-dls]

Document level security (DLS) enables you to restrict access to documents in your Elasticsearch indices according to user and group permissions. This ensures search results only return authorized information for users, based on their permissions.


## Availability & prerequisites [es-dls-availability-prerequisites]

Support for DLS in Elastic connectors was introduced in version **8.9.0**.

::::{note}
This feature is in **beta** and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

::::


This feature is not available for all Elastic subscription levels. Refer to the subscriptions pages for [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions/cloud) and [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

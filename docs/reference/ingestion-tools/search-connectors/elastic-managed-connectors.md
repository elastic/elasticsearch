# Elastic managed connectors [es-native-connectors]

::::{important}
As of Elastic 9.0, managed connectors on Elastic Cloud Hosted are no longer available. All connectors must be [self-managed](/reference/ingestion-tools/search-connectors/self-managed-connectors.md).

Refer to the [8.18 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.18/es-native-connectors.html) if you are using an older version of Elastic.

# Docker Compose quickstart [es-connectors-docker-compose-quickstart]

Use our Docker Compose quickstart to easily set up a full self-managed stack and try out Elastic Connectors.

Weâ€™ve provided a script to start up and run Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Connectors instances using Docker Compose. The script prompts you to configure your Connectors before starting. Additionally, you can use the same set of scripts to manually configure your Connectors and run the stack.

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main/scripts/stack#readme) in the [elastic/connectors](https://github.com/elastic/connectors) source repository for more information.

### Availability and prerequisites [es-connectors-outlook-client-availability-and-prerequisites]

This connector is available as a self-managed connector. To use this connector, satisfy all [self-managed connector prerequisites](/reference/ingestion-tools/search-connectors/self-managed-connectors.md).


### Create a Outlook connector [es-connectors-outlook-create-connector-client]


#### Use the UI [es-connectors-outlook-client-create-use-the-ui]

To create a new Outlook connector:

1. In the Kibana UI, navigate to the **Search → Content → Connectors** page from the main menu, or use the [global search field](docs-content://explore-analyze/query-filter/filtering.md#_finding_your_apps_and_objects).
2. Follow the instructions to create a new  **Outlook** self-managed connector.


#### Use the API [es-connectors-outlook-client-create-use-the-api]

You can use the {{es}} [Create connector API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-connector) to create a new self-managed Outlook self-managed connector.

For example:

```console
PUT _connector/my-outlook-connector
{
  "index_name": "my-elasticsearch-index",
  "name": "Content synced from Outlook",
  "service_type": "outlook"
}
```

:::::{dropdown} You’ll also need to create an API key for the connector to use.
::::{note}
The user needs the cluster privileges `manage_api_key`, `manage_connector` and `write_connector_secrets` to generate API keys programmatically.

::::


To create an API key for the connector:

1. Run the following command, replacing values where indicated. Note the `encoded` return values from the response:

    ```console
    POST /_security/api_key
    {
      "name": "connector_name-connector-api-key",
      "role_descriptors": {
        "connector_name-connector-role": {
          "cluster": [
            "monitor",
            "manage_connector"
          ],
          "indices": [
            {
              "names": [
                "index_name",
                ".search-acl-filter-index_name",
                ".elastic-connectors*"
              ],
              "privileges": [
                "all"
              ],
              "allow_restricted_indices": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2. Update your `config.yml` file with the API key `encoded` value.

### Connecting to Outlook [es-connectors-outlook-client-connecting-to-outlook]

Outlook connector supports both cloud (Office365 Outlook) and on-premises (Exchange Server) platforms.


#### Connect to Exchange Server [es-connectors-outlook-client-connect-to-exchange-server]

In order to connect to Exchange server, the connector fetches Active Directory users with the help of `ldap3` python library.


#### Connect to Office365 Outlook (Outlook Cloud) [es-connectors-outlook-client-connect-to-office365-outlook-outlook-cloud]

To integrate with the Outlook connector using Azure, follow these steps to create and configure an Azure application:

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and log in using your credentials.
2. Click on **App registrations** to register a new application.
3. Navigate to the **Overview** tab. Make a note of the `Client ID` and `Tenant ID`.
4. Click on the **Certificates & secrets** tab and create a new client secret. Keep this secret handy.
5. Go to the **API permissions** tab.

    * Click on "Add permissions."
    * Choose "APIs my organization uses."
    * Search for and select "Office 365 Exchange Online."
    * Add the `full_access_as_app` application permission.


You can now use the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret you’ve noted to configure the Outlook connector.

### Deployment using Docker [es-connectors-outlook-client-client-docker]

You can deploy the Outlook connector as a self-managed connector using Docker. Follow these instructions.

::::{dropdown} Step 1: Download sample configuration file
Download the sample configuration file. You can either download it manually or run the following command:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/connectors/main/config.yml.example --output ~/connectors-config/config.yml
```

Remember to update the `--output` argument value if your directory name is different, or you want to use a different config file name.

::::


::::{dropdown} Step 2: Update the configuration file for your self-managed connector
Update the configuration file with the following settings to match your environment:

* `elasticsearch.host`
* `elasticsearch.api_key`
* `connectors`

If you’re running the connector service against a Dockerized version of Elasticsearch and Kibana, your config file will look like this:

```yaml
# When connecting to your cloud deployment you should edit the host value
elasticsearch.host: http://host.docker.internal:9200
elasticsearch.api_key: <ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY>

connectors:
  -
    connector_id: <CONNECTOR_ID_FROM_KIBANA>
    service_type: outlook
    api_key: <CONNECTOR_API_KEY_FROM_KIBANA> # Optional. If not provided, the connector will use the elasticsearch.api_key instead
```

Using the `elasticsearch.api_key` is the recommended authentication method. However, you can also use `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` to authenticate with your Elasticsearch instance.

Note: You can change other default configurations by simply uncommenting specific settings in the configuration file and modifying their values.

::::


::::{dropdown} Step 3: Run the Docker image
Run the Docker image with the Connector Service using the following command:

```sh
docker run \
-v ~/connectors-config:/config \
--network "elastic" \
--tty \
--rm \
docker.elastic.co/integrations/elastic-connectors:9.0.0 \
/app/bin/elastic-ingest \
-c /config/config.yml
```

::::


Refer to [`DOCKER.md`](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main/docs/DOCKER.md) in the `elastic/connectors` repo for more details.

Find all available Docker images in the [official registry](https://www.docker.elastic.co/r/integrations/elastic-connectors).

::::{tip}
We also have a quickstart self-managed option using Docker Compose, so you can spin up all required services at once: Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the connectors service. Refer to this [README](https://github.com/elastic/connectors/tree/main/scripts/stack#readme) in the `elastic/connectors` repo for more information.

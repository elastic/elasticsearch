==== Request

`GET /_license/trial_status`

[discrete]
==== Description

If you want to try all the subscription features, you can start a 30-day trial. 

NOTE: You are allowed to initiate a trial only if your cluster has not
already activated a trial for the current major product version. For example, if
you have already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new trial until
v7.0. You can, however, request an extended trial at {extendtrial}.

For more information about features and subscriptions, see
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.

==== Authorization

You must have `monitor` cluster privileges to use this API.

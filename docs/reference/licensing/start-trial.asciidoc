This API starts a 30-day trial license.

==== Request

`POST /_license/start_trial`

==== Description

The `start trial` API enables you to upgrade from a basic license to a 30-day
trial license, which gives access to the platinum features.

NOTE: You are allowed to initiate a trial license only if your cluster has not
already activated a trial license for the current major product version. For
example, if you have already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new
trial until v7.0. You can, however, contact `info@elastic.co` to request an
extended trial license.

To check the status of your trial license, use the following API:
<<get-trial-status>>. 

For more information about the different types of licenses, see
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.

==== Authorization

You must have `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].

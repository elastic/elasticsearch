== Meta-Fields

Each document has metadata associated with it, such as the `_index`, mapping
<<mapping-type-field,`_type`>>, and `_id` meta-fields.  The behaviour of some of these meta-fields
can be customised when a mapping type is created.

The meta-fields are:

[horizontal]
<<mapping-index-field,`_index`>>::

    The index to which the document belongs.

<<mapping-uid-field,`_uid`>>::

    A composite field consisting of the `_type` and the `_id`.

<<mapping-type-field,`_type`>>::

    The document's <<all-mapping-types,mapping type>>.

<<mapping-id-field,`_id`>>::

    The document's ID.

<<mapping-source-field,`_source`>>::

    The original JSON representing the body of the document.

<<mapping-all-field,`_all`>>::

    A _catch-all_  field that indexes the values of all other fields.

<<mapping-field-names-field,`_field_names`>>::

    All fields in the document which contain non-null values.

<<mapping-parent-field,`_parent`>>::

    Used to create a parent-child relationship between two mapping types.

<<mapping-routing-field,`_routing`>>::

    A custom routing value which routes a document to a particular shard.

<<mapping-size-field,`_size`>>::

    The size of the `_source` field in bytes.

<<mapping-timestamp-field,`_timestamp`>>::

    A timestamp associated with the document, either specified manually or auto-generated.

<<mapping-ttl-field,`_ttl`>>::

    How long a document should live before it is automatically deleted.

[[enabled]]
=== `enabled`

Elasticsearch tries to index all of the fields you give it, but sometimes you
want to just store the field without indexing it. For instance, imagine that
you are using Elasticsearch as a web session store. You may want to index the
session ID and last update time, but you don't need to query or run
aggregations on the session data itself.

The `enabled` setting, which can be applied only to the top-level mapping
definition and to <<object,`object`>> fields, causes Elasticsearch to skip
parsing of the contents of the field entirely. The JSON can still be retrieved
from the <<mapping-source-field,`_source`>> field, but it is not searchable or
stored in any other way:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "user_id": {
        "type":  "keyword"
      },
      "last_updated": {
        "type": "date"
      },
      "session_data": { <1>
        "type": "object",
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/session_1
{
  "user_id": "kimchy",
  "session_data": { <2>
    "arbitrary_object": {
      "some_array": [ "foo", "bar", { "baz": 2 } ]
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2015-12-06T18:20:22"
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/session_2
{
  "user_id": "jpountz",
  "session_data": "none", <3>
  "last_updated": "2015-12-06T18:22:13"
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The `session_data` field is disabled.
<2> Any arbitrary data can be passed to the `session_data` field as it will be entirely ignored.
<3> The `session_data` will also ignore values that are not JSON objects.

The entire mapping may be disabled as well, in which case the document is
stored in the <<mapping-source-field,`_source`>> field, which means it can be
retrieved, but none of its contents are indexed in any way:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "enabled": false <1>
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/session_1
{
  "user_id": "kimchy",
  "session_data": {
    "arbitrary_object": {
      "some_array": [ "foo", "bar", { "baz": 2 } ]
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2015-12-06T18:20:22"
}

GET my-index-000001/_doc/session_1 <2>

GET my-index-000001/_mapping <3>
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The entire mapping is disabled.
<2> The document can be retrieved.
<3> Checking the mapping reveals that no fields have been added.

The `enabled` setting for existing fields and the top-level mapping
definition cannot be updated.

Note that because Elasticsearch completely skips parsing the field
contents, it is possible to add non-object data to a disabled field:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "session_data": {
        "type": "object",
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/session_1
{
  "session_data": "foo bar" <1>
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The document is added successfully, even though `session_data` contains non-object data.

[[index-options]]
=== `index_options`

The `index_options` parameter controls what information is added to the
inverted index, for search and highlighting purposes.  It accepts the
following settings:

[horizontal]
`docs`::

    Only the doc number is indexed.  Can answer the question _Does this term
    exist in this field?_

`freqs`::

    Doc number and term frequencies are indexed.  Term frequencies are used to
    score repeated terms higher than single terms.

`positions`::

    Doc number, term frequencies, and term positions (or order) are indexed.
    Positions can be used for
    <<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,proximity or phrase queries>>.

`offsets`::

    Doc number, term frequencies, positions, and start and end character
    offsets (which map the term back to the original string) are indexed.
    Offsets are used by the <<postings-highlighter,postings highlighter>>.

<<mapping-index,Analyzed>> string fields use `positions` as the default, and
all other fields use `docs` as the default.

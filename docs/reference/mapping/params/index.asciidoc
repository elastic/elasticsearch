[[mapping-index]]
=== `index`

The `index` option controls whether field values are indexed. It accepts `true`
or `false` and defaults to `true`. 

Indexing a field creates data structures that enable the field to be queried 
efficiently. <<number,Numeric types>>, <<date,date types>>,
the <<boolean,boolean type>>, <<ip,ip type>>, <<geo-point,geo_point type>> and the
<<keyword,keyword type>> can also be queried when they are not <<mapping-index,indexed>>
 but only have doc values enabled. Queries on these fields are slow as a full scan
 of the index has to be made. All other fields are not queryable.

[[term-vector]]
=== `term_vector`

Term vectors contain information about the terms produced by the
<<analysis,analysis>> process, including:

* a list of terms.
* the position (or order) of each term.
* the start and end character offsets mapping the term to its
  origin in the original string.

These term vectors can be stored so that they can be retrieved for a
particular document.

The `term_vector` setting accepts:

[horizontal]
`no`::                      No term vectors are stored. (default)
`yes`::                     Just the terms in the field are stored.
`with_positions`::          Terms and positions are stored.
`with_offsets`::            Terms and character offsets are stored.
`with_positions_offsets`::  Terms, positions, and character offsets are stored.

The fast vector highlighter requires `with_positions_offsets`.  The term
vectors API can retrieve whatever is stored.

WARNING:  Setting `with_positions_offsets` will double the size of a field's
index.

// CONSOLE
<1> The fast vector highlighter will be used by default for the `text` field
    because term vectors are enabled.

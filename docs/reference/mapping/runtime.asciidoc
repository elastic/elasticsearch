[[runtime]]
== Runtime fields
Typically, you index data into {es} to promote faster search. However, indexing
can be slow and requires more disk space, and you have to reindex your data to
add fields to existing documents. With _runtime fields_, you can add
fields to documents already indexed to {es} without reindexing your data.

You access runtime fields from the search API like any other field, and {es}
sees runtime fields no differently.

[[runtime-benefits]]
=== Benefits
Because runtime fields aren't indexed, adding a runtime field doesn't increase
the index size. You define runtime fields directly in the index mapping, saving
storage costs and increasing ingestion speed. You can more quickly ingest
data into the Elastic Stack and access it right away. When you define a runtime
field, you can immediately use it in search requests, aggregations, filtering,
and sorting.

If you make a runtime field an indexed field, you don't need to modify any
queries that refer to the runtime field. Better yet, you can refer to some
indices where the field is a runtime field, and other indices where the field
is an indexed field. You have the flexibility to choose which fields to index
and which ones to keep as runtime fields.

[discrete]
[[runtime-use-cases]]
=== Use cases
Runtime fields are useful when working with log data
(see <<runtime-examples,examples>>), especially when you're unsure about the
data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index size is much
smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to index them.

Runtime fields are especially useful in the following contexts:

* Adding fields to documents that are already indexed without having to reindex
data
* Immediately begin working on a new data stream without fully understanding
the data it contains
* Shadowing an indexed field with a runtime field to fix a mistake after
indexing documents
* Defining fields that are only relevant for a particular context (such as a
visualization in {kib}) without influencing the underlying schema

[discrete]
[[runtime-compromises]]
=== Compromises
Runtime fields use less disk space and provide flexibility in how you access
your data, but can impact search performance based on the computation defined in
the runtime script.

To balance search performance and flexibility, index fields that you'll
commonly search for and filter on, such as a timestamp. {es} automatically uses
these indexed fields first when running a query, resulting in a fast response
time. You can then use runtime fields to limit the number of fields that {es}
needs to calculate values for. Using indexed fields in tandem with runtime
fields provides flexibility in the data that you index and how you define
queries for other fields.

Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>> to run searches that include
runtime fields. This method of search helps to offset the performance impacts
of computing values for runtime fields in each document containing that field.
If the query can't return the result set synchronously, you'll get results
asynchronously as they become available.

IMPORTANT: Queries against runtime fields are considered expensive. If
<<query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries,`search.allow_expensive_queries`>> is set
to `false`, expensive queries are not allowed and {es} will reject any queries
against runtime fields.

[[runtime-mapping-fields]]
=== Mapping a runtime field
You map runtime fields by adding a `runtime` section under the mapping
definition and defining
<<modules-scripting-using,a Painless script>>. This script has access to the
entire context of a document, including the original `_source` and any mapped
fields plus their values. At search time, the script runs and generates values
for each scripted field that is required for the query.

NOTE: You can define a runtime field in the mapping definition without a
script. If you define a runtime field without a script, {es} evaluates the
field at search time, looks at each document containing that field, retrieves
the `_source`, and returns a value if one exists.

Runtime fields are similar to the <<script-fields,`script_fields`>> parameter
of the `_search` request, but also make the script results available anywhere
in a search request.

The script in the following request extracts the day of the week from the
`@timestamp` field, which is defined as a `date` type:

[source,console]
----
PUT /my-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "runtime": { <1>
      "day_of_week": {
        "type": "keyword", <2>
        "script": { <3>
          "source": "emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))"
        }
      }
    },
    "properties": {
      "timestamp": {"type": "date"}
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Runtime fields are defined in the `runtime` section of the mapping
definition.
<2> Each runtime field has its own field type, just like any other field.
<3> The script defines the evaluation to calculate at search time.

The `runtime` section supports `boolean`, `date`, `double`, `geo_point`, `ip`,
`keyword`, and `long` data types. Runtime fields with a `type` of `date` can
accept the <<mapping-date-format,`format`>> parameter exactly as the `date`
field type.

[[runtime-updating-scripts]]
.Updating runtime scripts
****

Updating a script while a dependent query is running can return
inconsistent results. Each shard might have access to different versions of the
script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.

Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can
fail if you change the field type. For example, a bar chart visualization
that uses a runtime field of type `ip` will fail if the type is changed
to `boolean`.

****

[[runtime-search-request]]
=== Defining runtime fields in a search request
You can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request to create
runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. You specify a script
as part of the `runtime_mappings` section, just as you would if adding a
runtime field to the mappings.

Fields defined in the search request take precedence over fields defined with
the same name in the index mappings. This flexibility allows you to shadow
existing fields and calculate a different value in the search request, without
modifying the field itself. If you made a mistake in your index mapping, you
can use runtime fields to calculate values that override values in the mapping
during the search request.

In the following request, the values for the `day_of_week` field are calculated
dynamically, and only within the context of this search request:

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "day_of_week": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "script": {
        "source": "emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))"
      }
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "day_of_week": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "day_of_week"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

Defining a runtime field in a search request uses the same format as defining
a runtime field in the index mapping. That consistency means you can promote a
runtime field from a search request to the index mapping by moving the field
definition from `runtime_mappings` in the search request to the `runtime`
section of the index mapping.

[[runtime-shadowing-fields]]
=== Shadowing fields
If you create a runtime field with the same name as a field that
already exists in the mapping, the runtime field shadows the mapped field. At
search time, {es} evaluates the runtime field, calculates a value based on the
script, and returns the value as part of the query. Because the runtime field
shadows the mapped field, you can modify the value returned in search without
modifying the mapped field.

For example, let's say you indexed the following documents into `my-index`:

[source,console]
----
POST my-index/_bulk?refresh=true
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516729294000,"model_number":"QVKC92Q","measures":{"voltage":5.2}}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516642894000,"model_number":"QVKC92Q","measures":{"voltage":5.8}}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516556494000,"model_number":"QVKC92Q","measures":{"voltage":5.1}}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516470094000,"model_number":"QVKC92Q","measures":{"voltage":5.6}}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516383694000,"model_number":"HG537PU","measures":{"voltage":4.2}}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":1516297294000,"model_number":"HG537PU","measures":{"voltage":4.0}}
----

You later realize that the `HG537PU` sensors aren't reporting their true
voltage. The indexed values are supposed to be 1.7 times higher than
the reported values! Instead of reindexing your data, you can define a script in
the `runtime_mappings` section of the `_search` request to shadow the `voltage`
field and calculate a new value at search time.

If you search for documents where the model number matches `HG537PU`:

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "model_number": "HG537PU"
    }
  }
}
----
//TEST[continued]

The response includes indexed values for documents matching model number
`HG537PU`:

[source,console-result]

The following request defines a runtime field where the script evaluates the
`model_number` field where the value is `HG537PU`. For each match, the script
multiplies the value for the `voltage` field by `1.7`.

Using the <<search-fields,`fields`>> parameter on the `_search` API, you can
retrieve the value that the script calculates for the `measures.voltage` field
for documents matching the search request:

[source,console]
----
POST my-index/_search
{
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "measures.voltage": {
      "type": "double",
      "script": {
        "source":
        """if (doc['model_number.keyword'].value.equals('HG537PU'))
        {emit(1.7 * params._source['measures']['voltage']);}
        else{emit(params._source['measures']['voltage']);}"""
      }
    }
  },

    "match": {
      "model_number": "HG537PU"
    }
  },
  "fields": ["measures.voltage"]
}

//TEST[continued]

Looking at the response, the calculated values for `measures.voltage` on each
result are `7.14` and `6.8`. That's more like it! The runtime field calculated
this value as part of the search request without modifying the mapped value,
which still returns in the response:

[[runtime-retrieving-fields]]
=== Retrieving a runtime field
Use the <<search-fields,`fields`>> parameter on the `_search` API to retrieve
the values of runtime fields. Runtime fields won't display in `_source`, but
the `fields` API works for all fields, even those that were not sent as part of
the original `_source`.

The following request uses the search API to retrieve the `day_of_week` field
that <<runtime-mapping-fields,this previous request>> defined as a runtime field
in the mapping. The value for the `day_of_week` field is calculated dynamically
at search time based on the evaluation of the defined script.

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "fields": [
    "@timestamp",
    "day_of_week"
  ],
  "_source": false
}
----
// TEST[continued]

[[runtime-examples]]
=== Runtime fields examples
Consider a large set of log data that you want to extract fields from.
Indexing the data is time consuming and uses a lot of disk space, and you just
want to explore the data structure without committing to a schema up front.

You know that your log data contains specific fields that you want to extract.
By using runtime fields, you can define scripts to calculate values at search
time for these fields.

You can start with a simple example by adding the `@timestamp` and `message`
fields to the `my-index` mapping. To remain flexible, use `wildcard` as the
field type for `message`:

[source,console]
----
PUT /my-index/
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_second",
        "type": "date"
      },
      "message": {
        "type": "wildcard"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

After mapping the fields you want to retrieve, index a few records from
your log data into {es}. The following request uses the <<docs-bulk,bulk API>>
to index raw log data into `my-index`. Instead of indexing all of your log
data, you can use a small sample to experiment with runtime fields.

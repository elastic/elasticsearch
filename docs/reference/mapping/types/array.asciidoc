[[array]]
=== Arrays

In Elasticsearch, there is no dedicated `array` data type. Any field can contain
zero or more values by default, however, all values in the array must be of the
same data type. For instance:

* an array of strings: [ `"one"`, `"two"` ]
* an array of integers: [ `1`, `2` ]
* an array of arrays: [ `1`, [ `2`, `3` ]] which is the equivalent of [ `1`, `2`, `3` ]
* an array of objects: [ `{ "name": "Mary", "age": 12 }`, `{ "name": "John", "age": 10 }`]

.Arrays of objects
[NOTE]
====================================================

Arrays of objects do not work as you would expect: you cannot query each
object independently of the other objects in the array. If you need to be
able to do this then you should use the <<nested,`nested`>> data type instead
of the <<object,`object`>> data type.

This is explained in more detail in <<nested>>.
====================================================


When adding a field dynamically, the first value in the array determines the
field `type`. All subsequent values must be of the same data type or it must
at least be possible to <<coerce,coerce>> subsequent values to the same
data type.

Arrays with a mixture of data types are _not_ supported: [ `10`, `"some string"` ]

An array may contain `null` values, which are either replaced by the
configured <<null-value,`null_value`>> or skipped entirely. An empty array
`[]` is treated as a missing field -- a field with no values.

Nothing needs to be pre-configured in order to use arrays in documents, they
are supported out of the box:


[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1
{
  "message": "some arrays in this document...",
  "tags":  [ "elasticsearch", "wow" ], <1>
  "lists": [ <2>
    {
      "name": "prog_list",
      "description": "programming list"
    },
    {
      "name": "cool_list",
      "description": "cool stuff list"
    }
  ]
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/2 <3>
{
  "message": "no arrays in this document...",
  "tags":  "elasticsearch",
  "lists": {
    "name": "prog_list",
    "description": "programming list"
  }
}

GET my-index-000001/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "tags": "elasticsearch" <4>
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The `tags` field is dynamically added as a `string` field.
<2> The `lists` field is dynamically added as an `object` field.
<3> The second document contains no arrays, but can be indexed into the same fields.
<4> The query looks for `elasticsearch` in the `tags` field, and matches both documents.

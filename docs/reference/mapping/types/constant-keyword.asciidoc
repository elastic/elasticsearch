[[constant-keyword-field-type]]
=== Constant keyword field type

Constant keyword is a specialization of the `keyword` field for
the case that all documents in the index have the same value.

[source,console]
--------------------------------
PUT logs-debug
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "type": "date"
      },
      "message": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "level": {
        "type": "constant_keyword",
        "value": "debug"
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------

`constant_keyword` supports the same queries and aggregations as `keyword`
fields do, but takes advantage of the fact that all documents have the same
value per index to execute queries more efficiently.

It is both allowed to submit documents that don't have a value for the field or
that have a value equal to the value configured in mappings. The two below
indexing requests are equivalent:

[source,console]
--------------------------------
POST logs-debug/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-12-12",
  "message": "Starting up Elasticsearch",
  "level": "debug"
}

POST logs-debug/_doc
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-12-12",
  "message": "Starting up Elasticsearch"
}
--------------------------------
//TEST[continued]

However providing a value that is different from the one configured in the
mapping is disallowed.

In case no `value` is provided in the mappings, the field will automatically
configure itself based on the value contained in the first indexed document.
While this behavior can be convenient, note that it means that a single
poisonous document can cause all other documents to be rejected if it had a
wrong value.

Before a value has been provided (either through the mappings or from a
document), queries on the field will not match any documents. This includes
 <<query-dsl-exists-query,`exists`>> queries.

The `value` of the field cannot be changed after it has been set.

[[constant-keyword-params]]
==== Parameters for constant keyword fields

The following mapping parameters are accepted:

[horizontal]

<<mapping-field-meta,`meta`>>::

    Metadata about the field.

`value`::

    The value to associate with all documents in the index. If this parameter
    is not provided, it is set based on the first document that gets indexed.

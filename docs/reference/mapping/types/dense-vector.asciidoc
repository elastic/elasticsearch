[[dense-vector]]
=== Dense vector field type
++++
<titleabbrev>Dense vector</titleabbrev>
++++

The `dense_vector` field type stores dense vectors of numeric values. Dense
vector fields are primarily used for <<knn-search,k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search>>.

The `dense_vector` type does not support aggregations or sorting.

You add a `dense_vector` field as an array of numeric values
based on <<dense-vector-params, `element_type`>> with
`float` by default:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": 3
      },
      "my_text" : {
        "type" : "keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index/_doc/1
{
  "my_text" : "text1",
  "my_vector" : [0.5, 10, 6]
}

PUT my-index/_doc/2
{
  "my_text" : "text2",
  "my_vector" : [-0.5, 10, 10]
}

--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Unlike most other data types, dense vectors are always single-valued.
It is not possible to store multiple values in one `dense_vector` field.

[[index-vectors-knn-search]]
==== Index vectors for kNN search

include::{es-repo-dir}/search/search-your-data/knn-search.asciidoc[tag=knn-def]

Dense vector fields can be used to rank documents in
<<query-dsl-script-score-query,`script_score` queries>>. This lets you perform
a brute-force kNN search by scanning all documents and ranking them by
similarity.

In many cases, a brute-force kNN search is not efficient enough. For this
reason, the `dense_vector` type supports indexing vectors into a specialized
data structure to support fast kNN retrieval through the <<search-api-knn, `knn` option>> in the search API

Unmapped array fields of float elements with size between 128 and 4096 are dynamically mapped as `dense_vector` with a default similariy of `cosine`.
You can override the default similarity by explicitly mapping the field as `dense_vector` with the desired similarity.

Indexing is enabled by default for dense vector fields.
When indexing is enabled, you can define the vector similarity to use in kNN search:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-2
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": 3,
        "similarity": "dot_product"
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Indexing vectors for approximate kNN search is an expensive process. It
can take substantial time to ingest documents that contain vector fields with
`index` enabled. See <<tune-knn-search,k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search>> to
learn more about the memory requirements.

You can disable indexing by setting the `index` parameter to `false`:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-2
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": 3,
        "index": false
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

{es} uses the https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320[HNSW algorithm] to support
efficient kNN search. Like most kNN algorithms, HNSW is an approximate method
that sacrifices result accuracy for improved speed.

[[dense-vector-quantization]]
==== Automatically quantize vectors for kNN search

The `dense_vector` type supports quantization to reduce the memory footprint required when <<approximate-knn, searching>> `float` vectors.
Currently the only quantization method supported is `int8` and provided vectors `element_type` must be `float`. To use
a quantized index, you can set your index type to `int8_hnsw`.

When using the `int8_hnsw` index, each of the `float` vectors' dimensions are quantized to 1-byte integers. This can
reduce the memory footprint by as much as 75% at the cost of some accuracy. However, the disk usage can increase by
25% due to the overhead of storing the quantized and raw vectors.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-byte-quantized-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "dense_vector",
        "dims": 3,
        "index": true,
        "index_options": {
          "type": "int8_hnsw"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

[[dense-vector-params]]
==== Parameters for dense vector fields

The following mapping parameters are accepted:

[[dense-vector-element-type]]
`element_type`::
(Optional, string)
The data type used to encode vectors. The supported data types are
`float` (default) and `byte`. `float` indexes a 4-byte floating-point
value per dimension. `byte` indexes a 1-byte integer value per dimension.
Using `byte` can result in a substantially smaller index size with the
trade off of lower precision. Vectors using `byte` require dimensions with
integer values between -128 to 127, inclusive for both indexing and searching.

`dims`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of vector dimensions. Can't exceed `4096`. If `dims` is not specified,
it will be set to the length of the first vector added to the field.

`index`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, you can search this field using the <<knn-search-api, kNN search
API>>. Defaults to `true`.

[[dense-vector-similarity]]
`similarity`::
(Optional^*^, string)
The vector similarity metric to use in kNN search. Documents are ranked by
their vector field's similarity to the query vector. The `_score` of each
document will be derived from the similarity, in a way that ensures scores are
positive and that a larger score corresponds to a higher ranking. Defaults to `cosine`.
+
^*^ This parameter can only be specified when `index` is `true`.
+
.Valid values for `similarity`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`l2_norm`:::
Computes similarity based on the L^2^ distance (also known as Euclidean
distance) between the vectors. The document `_score` is computed as
`1 / (1 + l2_norm(query, vector)^2)`.

`dot_product`:::
Computes the dot product of two unit vectors. This option provides an optimized way
to perform cosine similarity. The constraints and computed score are defined
by `element_type`.
+
When `element_type` is `float`, all vectors must be unit length, including both
document and query vectors. The document `_score` is computed as
`(1 + dot_product(query, vector)) / 2`.
+
When `element_type` is `byte`, all vectors must have the same
length including both document and query vectors or results will be inaccurate.
The document `_score` is computed as
`0.5 + (dot_product(query, vector) / (32768 * dims))`
where `dims` is the number of dimensions per vector.

`cosine`:::
Computes the cosine similarity. During indexing {es} automatically
normalizes vectors with `cosine` similarity to unit length. This allows
to internally use `dot_product` for computing similarity, which is more efficient.
Original un-normalized vectors can be still accessed
through scripts. The document `_score`
is computed as `(1 + cosine(query, vector)) / 2`. The `cosine` similarity does
not allow vectors with zero magnitude, since cosine is not defined in this
case.

`max_inner_product`:::
Computes the maximum inner product of two vectors. This is similar to `dot_product`,
but doesn't require vectors to be normalized. This means that each vector's magnitude
can significantly effect the score. The document `_score` is adjusted to prevent negative
values. For `max_inner_product` values `< 0`, the `_score` is
`1 / (1 + -1 * max_inner_product(query, vector))`. For non-negative `max_inner_product` results
the `_score` is calculated `max_inner_product(query, vector) + 1`.
====

NOTE: Although they are conceptually related, the `similarity` parameter is
different from <<text,`text`>> field <<similarity,`similarity`>> and accepts
a distinct set of options.

[[dense-vector-index-options]]
`index_options`::
(Optional^*^, object)
An optional section that configures the kNN indexing algorithm. The HNSW
algorithm has two internal parameters that influence how the data structure is
built. These can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of results, at the
expense of slower indexing speed.
+
^*^ This parameter can only be specified when `index` is `true`.
+
.Properties of `index_options`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`type`:::
(Required, string)
The type of kNN algorithm to use. Can be either `hnsw` or `int8_hnsw`.

`m`:::
(Optional, integer)
The number of neighbors each node will be connected to in the HNSW graph.
Defaults to `16`.

`ef_construction`:::
(Optional, integer)
The number of candidates to track while assembling the list of nearest
neighbors for each new node. Defaults to `100`.

`confidence_interval`:::
(Optional, float)
Only applicable to `int8_hnsw` index types. The confidence interval to use when quantizing the vectors,
can be any value between and including `0.90` and `1.0`. This value restricts the values used when calculating
the quantization thresholds. For example, a value of `0.95` will only use the middle 95% of the values when
calculating the quantization thresholds (e.g. the highest and lowest 2.5% of values will be ignored).
Defaults to `1/(dims + 1)`.

[[dense-vector-synthetic-source]]
==== Synthetic `_source`

IMPORTANT: Synthetic `_source` is Generally Available only for TSDB indices
(indices that have `index.mode` set to `time_series`). For other indices
synthetic `_source` is in technical preview. Features in technical preview may
be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will work to fix
any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA
of official GA features.

`dense_vector` fields support <<synthetic-source,synthetic `_source`>> .

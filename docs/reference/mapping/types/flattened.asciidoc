[[flattened]]
=== Flattened field type
++++
<titleabbrev>Flattened</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, each subfield in an object is mapped and indexed separately. If
the names or types of the subfields are not known in advance, then they are
<<dynamic-mapping, mapped dynamically>>.

The `flattened` type provides an alternative approach, where the entire
object is mapped as a single field. Given an object, the `flattened`
mapping will parse out its leaf values and index them into one field as
keywords. The object's contents can then be searched through simple queries
and aggregations.

This data type can be useful for indexing objects with a large or unknown
number of unique keys. Only one field mapping is created for the whole JSON
object, which can help prevent a <<mapping-limit-settings, mappings explosion>>
from having too many distinct field mappings.

On the other hand, flattened object fields present a trade-off in terms of
search functionality. Only basic queries are allowed, with no support for
numeric range queries or highlighting. Further information on the limitations
can be found in the <<supported-operations, Supported operations>> section.

NOTE: The `flattened` mapping type should **not** be used for indexing all
document content, as it treats all values as keywords and does not provide full
search functionality. The default approach, where each subfield has its own
entry in the mappings, works well in the majority of cases.

A flattened object field can be created as follows:

[source,console]
--------------------------------
PUT bug_reports
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "labels": {
        "type": "flattened"
      }
    }
  }
}

POST bug_reports/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Results are not sorted correctly.",
  "labels": {
    "priority": "urgent",
    "release": ["v1.2.5", "v1.3.0"],
    "timestamp": {
      "created": 1541458026,
      "closed": 1541457010
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------
// TESTSETUP

During indexing, tokens are created for each leaf value in the JSON object. The
values are indexed as string keywords, without analysis or special handling for
numbers or dates.

Querying the top-level `flattened` field searches all leaf values in the
object:

[source,console]
--------------------------------
POST bug_reports/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {"labels": "urgent"}
  }
}
--------------------------------

To query on a specific key in the flattened object, object dot notation is used:

[source,console]
--------------------------------
POST bug_reports/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {"labels.release": "v1.3.0"}
  }
}
--------------------------------

[[supported-operations]]
==== Supported operations

Because of the similarities in the way values are indexed, `flattened`
fields share much of the same mapping and search functionality as
<<keyword, `keyword`>> fields.

Currently, flattened object fields can be used with the following query types:

- `term`, `terms`, and `terms_set`
- `prefix`
- `range`
- `match` and `multi_match`
- `query_string` and `simple_query_string`
- `exists`

When querying, it is not possible to refer to field keys using wildcards, as in
`{ "term": {"labels.time*": 1541457010}}`. Note that all queries, including
`range`, treat the values as string keywords. Highlighting is not supported on
`flattened` fields.

It is possible to sort on a flattened object field, as well as perform simple
keyword-style aggregations such as `terms`. As with queries, there is no
special support for numerics -- all values in the JSON object are treated as
keywords. When sorting, this implies that values are compared
lexicographically.

Flattened object fields currently cannot be stored. It is not possible to
specify the <<mapping-store, `store`>> parameter in the mapping.

[[search-fields-flattened]]
==== Retrieving flattened fields

Field values and concrete subfields can be retrieved using the
<<search-fields-param,fields parameter>>. content. Since the `flattened` field maps an
entire object with potentially many subfields as a single field, the response contains
the unaltered structure from `_source`.

Single subfields, however, can be fetched by specifying them explicitly in the request.
This only works for concrete paths, but not using wildcards:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "flattened_field": {
        "type": "flattened"
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1?refresh=true
{
  "flattened_field" : {
    "subfield" : "value"
  }
}

POST my-index-000001/_search
{
  "fields": ["flattened_field.subfield"],
  "_source": false
}
--------------------------------------------------

        "flattened_field.subfield" : [ "value" ]
      }

// TESTRESPONSE[s/"max_score" : 1.0/"max_score" : $body.hits.max_score/]
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"_score" : 1.0/"_score" : $body.hits.hits.0._score/]

You can also use a <<modules-scripting-painless,Painless script>> to retrieve
values from sub-fields of flattened fields. Instead of including
`doc['<field_name>'].value` in your Painless script, use
`doc['<field_name>.<sub-field_name>'].value`. For example, if you have a
flattened field called `label` with a `release` sub-field, your Painless script
would be `doc['labels.release'].value`.

For example, let's say your mapping contains two fields, one of which is of the
`flattened` type:

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "labels": {
        "type": "flattened"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Index a few documents containing your mapped fields. The `labels` field has
three sub-fields:

[source,console]
----
POST /my-index-000001/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{}}
{"title":"Something really urgent","labels":{"priority":"urgent","release":["v1.2.5","v1.3.0"],"timestamp":{"created":1541458026,"closed":1541457010}}}
{"index":{}}
{"title":"Somewhat less urgent","labels":{"priority":"high","release":["v1.3.0"],"timestamp":{"created":1541458026,"closed":1541457010}}}
{"index":{}}
{"title":"Not urgent","labels":{"priority":"low","release":["v1.2.0"],"timestamp":{"created":1541458026,"closed":1541457010}}}
----
// TEST[continued]

Because `labels` is a `flattened` field type, the entire object is mapped as a
single field. To retrieve values from this sub-field in a Painless script, use
the `doc['<field_name>.<sub-field_name>'].value` format.

[source,painless]
----
"script": {
  "source": """
    if (doc['labels.release'].value.equals('v1.3.0'))
    {emit(doc['labels.release'].value)}
    else{emit('Version mismatch')}
  """

[[flattened-params]]
==== Parameters for flattened object fields

The following mapping parameters are accepted:

[horizontal]

`depth_limit`::

    The maximum allowed depth of the flattened object field, in terms of nested
    inner objects. If a flattened object field exceeds this limit, then an
    error will be thrown. Defaults to `20`. Note that `depth_limit` can be
    updated dynamically through the <<indices-put-mapping, update mapping>> API.

<<doc-values,`doc_values`>>::

    Should the field be stored on disk in a column-stride fashion, so that it
    can later be used for sorting, aggregations, or scripting? Accepts `true`
    (default) or `false`.

<<eager-global-ordinals,`eager_global_ordinals`>>::

    Should global ordinals be loaded eagerly on refresh? Accepts `true` or
    `false` (default). Enabling this is a good idea on fields that are
    frequently used for terms aggregations.

<<ignore-above,`ignore_above`>>::

    Leaf values longer than this limit will not be indexed. By default, there
    is no limit and all values will be indexed. Note that this limit applies
    to the leaf values within the flattened object field, and not the length of
    the entire field.

<<mapping-index,`index`>>::

    Determines if the field should be searchable. Accepts `true` (default) or
    `false`.

<<index-options,`index_options`>>::

    What information should be stored in the index for scoring purposes.
    Defaults to `docs` but can also be set to `freqs` to take term frequency
    into account when computing scores.

<<null-value,`null_value`>>::

    A string value which is substituted for any explicit `null` values within
    the flattened object field. Defaults to `null`, which means null sields are
    treated as if it were missing.

<<similarity,`similarity`>>::

    Which scoring algorithm or _similarity_ should be used. Defaults
    to `BM25`.

`split_queries_on_whitespace`::

    Whether <<full-text-queries,full text queries>> should split the input on
    whitespace when building a query for this field. Accepts `true` or `false`
    (default).

`time_series_dimensions`::
    (Optional, array of strings) A list of fields inside the flattened object, where each field is a dimension
    of the time series. Each field is specified using the relative path from the
    root field and does not include the root field name.


[[flattened-synthetic-source]]
==== Synthetic `_source`

IMPORTANT: Synthetic `_source` is Generally Available only for TSDB indices
(indices that have `index.mode` set to `time_series`). For other indices
synthetic `_source` is in technical preview. Features in technical preview may
be changed or removed in a future release. Elastic will apply best effort to fix
any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA
of official GA features.

Flattened fields support <<synthetic-source,synthetic`_source`>> in their default
configuration. Synthetic `_source` cannot be used with <<doc-values,`doc_values`>>
disabled.

Synthetic source always sorts alphabetically and de-duplicates flattened fields.
For example:
[source,console,id=synthetic-source-flattened-sorting-example]
----
PUT idx
{
  "mappings": {
    "_source": { "mode": "synthetic" },
    "properties": {
      "flattened": { "type": "flattened" }
    }
  }
}
PUT idx/_doc/1
{
  "flattened": {
    "field": [ "apple", "apple", "banana", "avocado", "10", "200", "AVOCADO", "Banana", "Tangerine" ]
  }
}
----
// TEST[s/$/\nGET idx\/_doc\/1?filter_path=_source\n/]

Will become:
[source,console-result]
----
{
  "flattened": {
    "field": [ "10", "200", "AVOCADO", "Banana", "Tangerine", "apple", "avocado", "banana" ]
  }
}
----
// TEST[s/^/{"_source":/ s/\n$/}/]

Synthetic source always uses nested objects instead of array of objects.
For example:
[source,console,id=synthetic-source-flattened-array-example]
----
PUT idx
{
  "mappings": {
    "_source": { "mode": "synthetic" },
    "properties": {
      "flattened": { "type": "flattened" }
    }
  }
}
PUT idx/_doc/1
{
  "flattened": {
      "field": [
        { "id": 1, "name": "foo" },
        { "id": 2, "name": "bar" },
        { "id": 3, "name": "baz" }
      ]
  }
}
----
// TEST[s/$/\nGET idx\/_doc\/1?filter_path=_source\n/]

Will become (note the nested objects instead of the "flattened" array):
[source,console-result]
----
{
    "flattened": {
      "field": {
          "id": [ "1", "2", "3" ],
          "name": [ "bar", "baz", "foo" ]
      }
    }
}
----
// TEST[s/^/{"_source":/ s/\n$/}/]

Synthetic source always uses single-valued fields for one-element arrays.
For example:
[source,console,id=synthetic-source-flattened-single-value-example]
----
PUT idx
{
  "mappings": {
    "_source": { "mode": "synthetic" },
    "properties": {
      "flattened": { "type": "flattened" }
    }
  }
}
PUT idx/_doc/1
{
  "flattened": {
    "field": [ "foo" ]
  }
}
----
// TEST[s/$/\nGET idx\/_doc\/1?filter_path=_source\n/]

Will become (note the nested objects instead of the "flattened" array):
[source,console-result]

  "flattened": {
    "field": "foo"
  }
}

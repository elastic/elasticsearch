=== Geo-point field type
++++
<titleabbrev>Geo-point</titleabbrev>
++++

Fields of type `geo_point` accept latitude-longitude pairs, which can be used:

* to find geo-points within a <<query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query,bounding box>>,
  within a certain <<query-dsl-geo-distance-query,distance>> of a central point,
  or within a <<query-dsl-geo-polygon-query,polygon>> or within a <<query-dsl-geo-shape-query,geo_shape query>>.
* to aggregate documents <<search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation,geographically>>
  or by <<search-aggregations-bucket-geodistance-aggregation,distance>> from a central point.
* to integrate distance into a document's <<query-dsl-function-score-query,relevance score>>.
* to <<geo-sorting,sort>> documents by distance.

There are five ways that a geo-point may be specified, as demonstrated below:

[IMPORTANT]
.Geo-points expressed as an array or string
==================================================

Please note that string geo-points are ordered as `lat,lon`, while array
geo-points are ordered as the reverse: `lon,lat`.

Originally, `lat,lon` was used for both array and string, but the array
format was changed early on to conform to the format used by GeoJSON.

==================================================

[NOTE]
A point can be expressed as a {wikipedia}/Geohash[geohash].
Geohashes are {wikipedia}/Base32[base32] encoded strings of
the bits of the latitude and longitude interleaved. Each character in a geohash
adds additional 5 bits to the precision. So the longer the hash, the more
precise it is. For the indexing purposed geohashs are translated into
latitude-longitude pairs. During this process only first 12 characters are
used, so specifying more than 12 characters in a geohash doesn't increase the
precision. The 12 characters provide 60 bits, which should reduce a possible
error to less than 2cm.

[[geo-point-params]]
==== Parameters for `geo_point` fields

The following parameters are accepted by `geo_point` fields:

[horizontal]

<<ignore-malformed,`ignore_malformed`>>::

    If `true`, malformed geo-points are ignored. If `false` (default),
    malformed geo-points throw an exception and reject the whole document.
    A geo-point is considered malformed if its latitude is outside the range
    -90 <= latitude <= 90, or if its longitude is outside the range -180 <= longitude <= 180.
    Note that this cannot be set if the `script` parameter is used.

`ignore_z_value`::

    If `true` (default) three dimension points will be accepted (stored in source)
    but only latitude and longitude values will be indexed; the third dimension is
    ignored. If `false`, geo-points containing any more than latitude and longitude
    (two dimensions) values throw an exception and reject the whole document. Note
    that this cannot be set if the `script` parameter is used.

<<mapping-index,`index`>>::

    Should the field be searchable? Accepts `true` (default) and `false`.

<<null-value,`null_value`>>::

    Accepts an geopoint value which is substituted for any explicit `null` values.
    Defaults to `null`, which means the field is treated as missing. Note that this
    cannot be set if the `script` parameter is used.

`on_script_error`::

    Defines what to do if the script defined by the `script` parameter
    throws an error at indexing time. Accepts `fail` (default), which
    will cause the entire document to be rejected, and `continue`, which
    will register the field in the document's
    <<mapping-ignored-field,`_ignored`>> metadata field and continue
    indexing. This parameter can only be set if the `script` field is
    also set.

`script`::

    If this parameter is set, then the field will index values generated
    by this script, rather than reading the values directly from the
    source. If a value is set for this field on the input document, then
    the document will be rejected with an error.
    Scripts are in the same format as their
    <<runtime-mapping-fields,runtime equivalent>>, and should emit points
    as a pair of (lat, lon) double values.

==== Using geo-points in scripts

When accessing the value of a geo-point in a script, the value is returned as
a `GeoPoint` object, which allows access to the `.lat` and `.lon` values
respectively:

[source,painless]
--------------------------------------------------
def geopoint = doc['location'].value;
def lat      = geopoint.lat;
def lon      = geopoint.lon;
--------------------------------------------------

For performance reasons, it is better to access the lat/lon values directly:

[source,painless]
--------------------------------------------------
def lat      = doc['location'].lat;
def lon      = doc['location'].lon;
--------------------------------------------------

=== IP Type

An `ip` mapping type allows to store _ipv4_ addresses in a numeric form
allowing to easily sort, and range query it (using ip values).

The following table lists all the attributes that can be used with an ip
type:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Attribute |Description
|`index_name` |The name of the field that will be stored in the index.
Defaults to the property/field name.

|`store` |Set to `true` to store actual field in the index, `false` to not
store it. Defaults to `false` (note, the JSON document itself is stored,
and it can be retrieved from it).

|`index` |Set to `no` if the value should not be indexed. In this case,
`store` should be set to `true`, since if it's not indexed and not
stored, there is nothing to do with it.

|`precision_step` |The precision step (influences the number of terms 
generated for each number value). Defaults to `16`.

|`boost` |The boost value. Defaults to `1.0`.

|`null_value` |When there is a (JSON) null value for the field, use the
`null_value` as the field value. Defaults to not adding the field at
all.

|`include_in_all` |Should the field be included in the `_all` field (if
enabled). Defaults to `true` or to the parent `object` type setting.

|`doc_values` |Set to `true` to store field values in a column-stride fashion.
Automatically set to `true` when the <<fielddata-formats,`fielddata` format>> is `doc_values`.

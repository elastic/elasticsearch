=== Wildcard data type
++++
<titleabbrev>Wildcard</titleabbrev>
++++

A `wildcard` field stores values optimised for wildcard grep-like queries.
Wildcard queries are possible on other field types but suffer from constraints:

* `text` fields limit matching of any wildcard expressions to individual tokens rather than the original whole value held in a field
* `keyword` fields are untokenized but slow at performing wildcard queries (especially patterns with leading wildcards).

Internally the `wildcard` field indexes the whole field value using ngrams and stores the full string.
The index is used as a rough filter to cut down the number of values that are then checked by retrieving and checking the full values.
This field is especially well suited to run grep-like queries on log lines. Storage costs are typically lower than those of `keyword`
fields but search speeds for exact matches on full terms are slower.

You index and search a wildcard field as follows

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_wildcard": {
        "type": "wildcard"
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1
{
  "my_wildcard" : "This string can be quite lengthy"
}

POST my-index-000001/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
      "wildcard" : "*quite*lengthy"
  }
}

[[wildcard-params]]
==== Parameters for wildcard fields

The following parameters are accepted by `wildcard` fields:

[horizontal]

<<ignore-above,`ignore_above`>>::

    Do not index any string longer than this value.  Defaults to `2147483647`
    so that all values would be accepted.

==== Limitations

* `wildcard` fields are untokenized like keyword fields, so do not support queries that rely on word positions such as phrase queries.

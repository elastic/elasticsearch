Cancels a running data stream reindex task which was started by the <<data-stream-reindex-api, data stream reindex API>>.
Any backing indices that have already been reindexed and swapped into the data stream will remain in the data stream.
Only backing indices which are currently being reindexed, or pending backing indices which are still waiting to be reindexed, will be cancelled.
Once a data stream reindex task is cancelled it will no longer be accessible through the
<<data-stream-reindex-status-api,status API>>. If a reindex task is not currently running
this API will return `resource_not_found_exception`.

The reindex data stream API is used to upgrade the backing indices of a data stream to the most
recent major version. It works by reindexing each backing index then replacing the original
backing index with its replacement and deleting the original backing index. The settings and mappings
from the original backing indices are copied to the resulting backing indices.

This api runs asynchronously because the process of reindexing all indices in a large data stream
is expected to take and extended period of time. The endpoint will return immediately and a persistent
task will be created to run in the background. The current status of the task can be checked with
the <<data-stream-reindex-status-api,reindex status API>>. This status will be available for 24 hours after the task completes, whether
it finished successfully or fails. A running data stream reindex task can be cancelled using the
<<data-stream-reindex-cancel-api,reindex cancel API>>.

[[data-stream-reindex-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`POST /_migration/reindex`


[[data-stream-reindex-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage`
<<privileges-list-indices,index privilege>> for the data stream.

[[data-stream-reindex-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`source`::
`index`:::
(Required, string) The name of the data stream you are upgrading.

`mode`::
(Required, enum) Set to `upgrade` to upgrade the data stream in-place, using the same source and destination
data stream. Each backing index will be reindexed, then swapped into the data stream, then the old index will be deleted.
Currently, the only allowed value for this parameter is `upgrade`.

[[reindex-data-stream-api-settings]]
==== Settings

You can use the following settings to control the behavior of the reindex data stream API:

[[migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-setting]]
// tag::migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-setting-tag[]
`migrate.max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream`
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The number of backing indices within a given data stream which will be reindexed concurrently. Defaults to `1`.
// end::migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-tag[]

[[migrate_data_stream_reindex_max_request_per_second-setting]]
// tag::migrate_data_stream_reindex_max_request_per_second-setting-tag[]
`migrate.data_stream_reindex_max_request_per_second`
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The number of requests per second used by the <<docs-reindex, reindex>> operation performed on every backing index.
This can be any decimal number greater than `0`, though it defaults to `10`. The value can also be `-1`, which will
cause there to be no throttling. Consult the reindex documentation for more information.
// end::migrate_data_stream_reindex_max_request_per_second-tag[]


[[reindex-data-stream-api-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

Assume we have a data stream `my-data-stream` with the following backing indices, all of which have index major version 7.x.

* .ds-my-data-stream-2024.01.07-000001
* .ds-my-data-stream-2024.02.07-000002
* .ds-my-data-stream-2024.03.07-000003

Let's also assume that `.ds-my-data-stream-2024.03.07-000003` is the write index.
If the {es} is version 8.x and we wish to upgrade to major version 9.x, the version 7.x indices must be upgraded in preparation.
We can use this API to reindex a data stream with version 7.x backing indices and make them version 8 backing indices.

We start with a call the the API:

[source,console]
----
POST _migration/reindex
{
    "source": {
        "index": "my-data-stream"
    },
    "mode": "upgrade"
}
----

As this task runs in the background this API will return immediately.
The task will do the following:

First, the data stream is rolled over. So that no documents are lost during the reindex, we make the existing backing indices
read-only before reindexing them. Since we cannot make a data stream's write index read-only, we must rollover the data
stream. This will produce a new write index `.ds-my-data-stream-2025.01.17-000004`, which will have be major version 8,
and thus does not need to be upgraded.

Once the data stream has a write index with an update-to-date major version we can proceed with reindexing the old indices.
For each of the version 7 indices, we now do the following:

* Set the index to read-only to guarantee that no writes are lost
* Delete the target index if one exists. This is done so that if the per-index processing needs to be retried, we start with a new target index.
* Create the target index using <create-from>. This copies the settings and mappings from the old backing index to the new backing index.
* Use the <reindex API> to copy the contents of the old backing index to the new backing index.
* Replace the old index in the data stream with the new index, using the <modify data stream API>.
* Finally, the old backing index is deleted.

By default only one backing index will be processed at a time. If it is better to reindex multiple backing indices
concurrently, this can be controlled by the <migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-setting, max.concurrent.indices setting>.

+
+
While the reindex data stream task is running, we can inspect the current status:

[source,console-result]
----
GET _migration/reindex/my-data-stream/_status
----

For example, we might be the following response. This shows there was an error because the user running this API
does not have adequate permissions for the data stream.

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-17T20:50:47.349",
  "start_time_millis": "1737147047349",
  "complete": false,
  "total_indices_in_data_stream": 4,
  "total_indices_requiring_upgrade": 3,
  "successes": 0,
  "in_progress": [
    {
      "index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2024.01.07-000001",
      "total_doc_count": 164937,
      "reindexed_doc_count": 6849
    }
  ],
  "pending": 2,
  "errors": []
}
----

Assume at this point the user has obtained the correct permissions. We can now re-run the task

[source,console-result]
----
POST _migration/reindex
{
    "source": {
        "index": "my-data-stream"
    },
    "mode": "upgrade"
}
----

And now checking the status we get the following:
[source,console-result]
----
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-17T20:50:47.349",
  "start_time_millis": "1737147047349",
  "complete": false,
  "total_indices_in_data_stream": 4,
  "total_indices_requiring_upgrade": 3,
  "successes": 0,
  "in_progress": [
    {
      "index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2024.01.07-000001",
      "total_doc_count": 164937,
      "reindexed_doc_count": 6849
    }
  ],
  "pending": 2,
  "errors": []
}
----

This output means that the first backing index, `.ds-my-data-stream-2024.01.07-000001`, is currently being processed,
and none of the backing indices have already been completed. Notice that `total_indices_in_data_stream` has a value of `4`
because, after the rollover, there are 4 indices in the data stream. But the new write index has version 8, and
thus doesn't need to be reindexed, so `total_indices_requiring_upgrade` is only 3.

+
After the first backing index has completed, status might return the following:
[source,console-result]
----
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-17T20:50:47.349",
  "start_time_millis": "1737147047349",
  "complete": false,
  "total_indices_in_data_stream": 4,
  "total_indices_requiring_upgrade": 3,
  "successes": 0,
  "in_progress": [
    {
      "index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2024.02.07-000002",
      "total_doc_count": 100000,
      "reindexed_doc_count": 999
    }
  ],
  "pending": 1,
  "errors": []
}
----

Perhaps some time later we decide that `.ds-my-data-stream-2024.02.07-000002` hasn't made much progress. We can see this
with the values `reindexed_doc_count` and `total_doc_count`, where `reindexed_doc_count/total_doc_count` is the percent
completion of the index currently being reindexed.
+
A possible solution is to change the value of the <migrate_data_stream_reindex_max_request_per_second-setting,max request setting>.
Update this setting would effect the reindexing of backing indices which have not yet started, but would not effect
 `.ds-my-data-stream-2024.02.07-000002`. Since this index has not progressed very far, we can cancel the task and then optimize the setting value.

We run the following to cancel the task:

[source,console-result]
----
POST _migration/reindex/my-data-stream/_cancel
----

After setting <blank> to the appropriate value, but can restart the task:

[source,console-result]
----
POST _migration/reindex
{
    "source": {
        "index": "my-data-stream"
    },
    "mode": "upgrade"
}
----

Checking the status again shortly will show the following:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-17T20:50:47.349",
  "start_time_millis": "1737147047349",
  "complete": false,
  "total_indices_in_data_stream": 4,
  "total_indices_requiring_upgrade": 2,
  "successes": 0,
  "in_progress": [
    {
      "index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2024.02.07-000002",
      "total_doc_count": 100000,
      "reindexed_doc_count": 999
    }
  ],
  "pending": 1,
  "errors": []
}
----

Notice that `total_indices_requiring_upgrade` is now 2 instead of 3. This is because we successfully upgraded the first
backing index in th previous run the task.
+
Once all backing indices have been reindexes, the status will still avaibable to look up for 24 hours after the completion
of the task. After completion we get the following output:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-17T20:50:47.349",
  "start_time_millis": "1737147047349",
  "complete": true,
  "total_indices_in_data_stream": 4,
  "total_indices_requiring_upgrade": 2,
  "successes": 2,
  "in_progress": [],
  "pending": 0,
  "errors": []
}
----


We can now check the data stream to verify that indices were upgraded.

[source,console-result]
----
GET /_data_stream/my-data-stream?filter-path=datastreams.indices.index_name
----

We now get these results:
[source,console-result]
----
{
  "data_streams": [
    {
      "indices": [
        {
          "index_name": ".ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.07-000001",
        },
        {
          "index_name": ".ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.08-000002",
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

Index `` is the write index and didn't need to be upgraded because it was created with version 8.
The other three backing indices are now prefixed with `.migrated` because they have been upgraded.
+
We can now check the index versions and verify they are also version 8.
[source,console-result]
----
GET /.migrated .../
----

Which returns the results:
[source,console-result]
----
{
    "version" : {
        "created_string" : "8.18.0",
    }
}
----

The reindex data stream API is used to upgrade the backing indices of a data stream to the most
recent major version. It works by reindexing each backing index then replacing the original
backing index with its replacement and deleting the original backing index. The settings and mappings
from the original backing indices are copied to the resulting backing indices.

This api runs asynchronously because the process of reindexing all indices in a large data stream
is expected to take and extended period of time. The endpoint will return immediately and a persistent
task will be created to run in the background. The current status of the task can be checked with
the INSERT_STATUS_API. This status will be available for 24 hours after the task completes, whether
it finished successfully or fails. A running data stream reindex task can be cancelled using the
CANCEL_API.

[[reindex-data-stream-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`POST /_migration/reindex`


[[reindex-data-stream-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the following
security privileges:

** The `read` <<privileges-list-indices,index privilege>> for the source data
stream.
** The `write` index privilege for the source data stream.

** The `delete_index` privilege.


[[reindex-data-stream-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`source`::
`index`:::
(Required, string) The name of the data stream you are upgrading.

`mode`::
(Required, enum) Set to `upgrade` to upgrade the data stream in-place, using the same source and destination
data stream. Each backing index will be reindexed, then swapped into the data stream, then the old index will be deleted.
Currently, the only allowed value for this parameter is `upgrade`.


[[reindex-data-stream-api-settings]]
==== Settings

You can use the following settings to control the behavior of the reindex data stream API:

[[migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-setting]]
// tag::migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-setting-tag[]
`migrate.max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream`
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The number of backing indices within a given data stream which will be reindexed concurrently. Defaults to `1`.
// end::migrate_max_concurrent_indices_reindexed_per_data_stream-tag[]

[[reindex-data-stream-api-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

To see the list of offenders in your cluster, submit a GET request to the
`_migration/reindex` endpoint:

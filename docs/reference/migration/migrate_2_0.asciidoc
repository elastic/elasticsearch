== Breaking changes in 2.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 2.0.

=== Indices API

The <<alias-retrieving, get alias api>> will, by default produce an error response
if a requested index does not exist. This change brings the defaults for this API in
line with the other Indices APIs. The <<multi-index>> options can be used on a request
to change this behavior

`GetIndexRequest.features()` now returns an array of Feature Enums instead of an array of String values.
The following deprecated methods have been removed:
* `GetIndexRequest.addFeatures(String[])` - Please use `GetIndexRequest.addFeatures(Feature[])` instead
* `GetIndexRequest.features(String[])` - Please use `GetIndexRequest.features(Feature[])` instead
* `GetIndexRequestBuilder.addFeatures(String[])` - Please use `GetIndexRequestBuilder.addFeatures(Feature[])` instead
* `GetIndexRequestBuilder.setFeatures(String[])` - Please use `GetIndexRequestBuilder.setFeatures(Feature[])` instead

=== Partial fields

Partial fields were deprecated since 1.0.0beta1 in favor of <<search-request-source-filtering,source filtering>>.

=== More Like This Field

The More Like This Field query has been removed in favor of the <<query-dsl-mlt-query, More Like This Query>>
restrained set to a specific `field`.

=== Routing

The default hash function that is used for routing has been changed from djb2 to
murmur3. This change should be transparent unless you relied on very specific
properties of djb2. This will help ensure a better balance of the document counts
between shards.

In addition, the following node settings related to routing have been deprecated:

[horizontal]

`cluster.routing.operation.hash.type`::

  This was an undocumented setting that allowed to configure which hash function
  to use for routing. `murmur3` is now enforced on new indices.

`cluster.routing.operation.use_type`::

  This was an undocumented setting that allowed to take the `_type` of the
  document into account when computing its shard (default: `false`). `false` is
  now enforced on new indices.

=== Store

The `memory` / `ram` store (`index.store.type`) option was removed in Elasticsearch 2.0.

=== Term Vectors API

Usage of `/_termvector` is deprecated, and replaced in favor of `/_termvectors`.

=== Script fields

Script fields in 1.x were only returned as a single value. So even if the return
value of a script used to be list, it would be returned as an array containing
a single value that is a list too, such as:

[source,json]
---------------
"fields": {
  "my_field": [
    [
      "v1",
      "v2"
    ]
  ]
}
---------------

In elasticsearch 2.x, scripts that return a list of values are considered as
multivalued fields. So the same example would return the following response,
with values in a single array.

[source,json]
---------------
"fields": {
  "my_field": [
    "v1",
    "v2"
  ]
}
---------------

=== Main API

Previously, calling `GET /` was giving back the http status code within the json response
in addition to the actual HTTP status code. We removed `status` field in json response.

=== Java API

Some query builders have been removed or renamed:

* `commonTerms(...)` renamed with `commonTermsQuery(...)`
* `queryString(...)` renamed with `queryStringQuery(...)`
* `simpleQueryString(...)` renamed with `simpleQueryStringQuery(...)`
* `textPhrase(...)` removed
* `textPhrasePrefix(...)` removed
* `textPhrasePrefixQuery(...)` removed
* `filtered(...)` removed. Use `filteredQuery(...)` instead.
* `inQuery(...)` removed.

==== Aggregations

The `date_histogram` aggregation now returns a `Histogram` object in the response, and the `DateHistogram` class has been removed. Similarly
the `date_range`, `ipv4_range`, and `geo_distance` aggregations all return a `Range` object in the response, and the `IPV4Range`, `DateRange`,
and `GeoDistance` classes have been removed. The motivation for this is to have a single response API for the Range and Histogram aggregations
regardless of the type of data being queried.  To support this some changes were made in the `MultiBucketAggregation` interface which applies
to all bucket aggregations:

* The `getKey()` method now returns `Object` instead of `String`. The actual object type returned depends on the type of aggregation requested
(e.g. the `date_histogram` will return a `DateTime` object for this method whereas a `histogram` will return a `Number`).
* A `getKeyAsString()` method has been added to return the String representation of the key.
* All other `getKeyAsX()` methods have been removed.
* The `getBucketAsKey(String)` methods have been removed on all aggregations except the `filters` and `terms` aggregations.

The `histogram` and the `date_histogram` aggregation now support a simplified `offset` option that replaces the previous `pre_offset` and
`post_offset` rounding options. Instead of having to specify two separate offset shifts of the underlying buckets, the `offset` option
moves the bucket boundaries in positive or negative direction depending on its argument.

The `date_histogram` options for `pre_zone` and `post_zone` are replaced by the `time_zone` option. So far the `time_zone` option was
equivalent to `pre_zone`. The time zone conversion was performed before rounding the date values to be put inside the aggregation buckets.
This could lead to cases where bucket keys were not in UTC. This behavior is unified. Setting `time_zone` to a value like
"+01:00" now will lead to the bucket boundary calculations being applied in the specified time zone but the results are returned in UTC.
In addition to this, also the `pre_zone_adjust_large_interval` is removed because we now always return dates in UTC.

=== Terms filter lookup caching

The terms filter lookup mechanism does not support the `cache` option anymore
and relies on the filesystem cache instead. If the lookup index is not too
large, it is recommended to make it replicated to all nodes by setting
`index.auto_expand_replicas: 0-all` in order to remove the network overhead as
well.

=== Parent parameter on update request

The `parent` parameter has been removed from the update request. Before 2.x it just set the routing parameter. The
`routing` setting should be used instead. The `parent` setting was confusing, because it had the impression that the parent
a child documents points to can be changed but this is not true.

==== Delete by query

The meaning of the `_shards` headers in the delete by query response has changed. Before version 2.0 the `total`,
`successful` and `failed` fields in the header are based on the number of primary shards. The failures on replica
shards aren't being kept track of. From version 2.0 the stats in the `_shards` header are based on all shards
of an index. The http status code is left unchanged and is only based on failures that occurred while executing on
primary shards.

=== Mappings

* The setting `index.mapping.allow_type_wrapper` has been removed.  Documents should always be sent without the type as the root element.

==== Removed type prefix on field names in queries
Types can no longer be specified on fields within queries.  Instead, specify type restrictions in the search request.

The following is an example query in 1.x over types `t1` and `t2`:
`GET
[source,sh]
---------------
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/index/_search'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {"match": { "t1.field_only_in_t1": "foo" }},
        {"match": { "t2.field_only_in_t2": "bar" }}
      ]
    }
  }
}
---------------

In 2.0, the query should look like the following:
---------------
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/index/t1,t2/_search'
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {"match": { "field_only_in_t1": "foo" }},
        {"match": { "field_only_in_t2": "bar" }}
      ]
    }
  }
}
---------------

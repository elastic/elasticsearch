== Breaking changes in 2.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 2.0.

=== Indices API

The <<alias-retrieving, get alias api>> will, by default produce an error response 
if a requested index does not exist. This change brings the defaults for this API in 
line with the other Indices APIs. The <<multi-index>> options can be used on a request 
to change this behavior

=== Partial fields

Partial fields were deprecated since 1.0.0beta1 in favor of <<search-request-source-filtering,source filtering>>.

=== More Like This Field

The More Like This Field query has been removed in favor of the <<query-dsl-mlt-query, More Like This Query>>
restrained set to a specific `field`.

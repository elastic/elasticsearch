=== Java API changes

==== Transport API construction

The `TransportClient` construction code has changed, it now uses the builder
pattern. Instead of:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
Settings settings = Settings.settingsBuilder()
        .put("cluster.name", "myClusterName").build();
Client client = new TransportClient(settings);
--------------------------------------------------

Use the following:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
Settings settings = Settings.settingsBuilder()
        .put("cluster.name", "myClusterName").build();
Client client = TransportClient.builder().settings(settings).build();
--------------------------------------------------

==== Automatically thread client listeners

Previously, the user had to set request listener threads to `true` when on the
client side in order not to block IO threads on heavy operations. This proved
to be very trappy for users, and ended up creating problems that are very hard
to debug.

In 2.0, Elasticsearch automatically threads listeners that are used from the
client when the client is a node client or a transport client. Threading can
no longer be manually set.


==== Query/filter refactoring

`org.elasticsearch.index.queries.FilterBuilders` has been removed as part of the merge of
queries and filters. These filters are now available in `QueryBuilders` with the same name.
All methods that used to accept a `FilterBuilder` now accept a `QueryBuilder` instead.

In addition some query builders have been removed or renamed:

* `commonTerms(...)` renamed with `commonTermsQuery(...)`
* `queryString(...)` renamed with `queryStringQuery(...)`
* `simpleQueryString(...)` renamed with `simpleQueryStringQuery(...)`
* `textPhrase(...)` removed
* `textPhrasePrefix(...)` removed
* `textPhrasePrefixQuery(...)` removed
* `filtered(...)` removed. Use `filteredQuery(...)` instead.
* `inQuery(...)` removed.

==== GetIndexRequest

`GetIndexRequest.features()` now returns an array of Feature Enums instead of an array of String values.

The following deprecated methods have been removed:

* `GetIndexRequest.addFeatures(String[])` - Use
  `GetIndexRequest.addFeatures(Feature[])` instead

* `GetIndexRequest.features(String[])` - Use
  `GetIndexRequest.features(Feature[])` instead.

* `GetIndexRequestBuilder.addFeatures(String[])` - Use
  `GetIndexRequestBuilder.addFeatures(Feature[])` instead.

* `GetIndexRequestBuilder.setFeatures(String[])` - Use
  `GetIndexRequestBuilder.setFeatures(Feature[])` instead.


==== BytesQueryBuilder removed

The redundant BytesQueryBuilder has been removed in favour of the
WrapperQueryBuilder internally.

==== TermsQueryBuilder execution removed

The `TermsQueryBuilder#execution` method has been removed as it has no effect, it is ignored by the
 corresponding parser.

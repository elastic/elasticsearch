=== Network changes

==== Bind to localhost

Elasticsearch 2.x will only bind to localhost by default. It will try to bind
to both 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) and [::1] (IPv6), but will work happily in
environments where only IPv4 or IPv6 is available. This change prevents
Elasticsearch from trying to connect to other nodes on your network unless you
specifically tell it to do so. When moving to production you should configure
the `network.host` parameter, either in the `elasticsearch.yml` config file or
on the command line:

[source,sh]
--------------------
bin/elasticsearch --network.host 192.168.1.5
bin/elasticsearch --network.host _non_loopback_
--------------------

The full list of options that network.host accepts can be found in the <<modules-network>>.

==== Multicast removed

Multicast has been removed (although it is still
{plugins}/discovery-multicast.html[provided as a plugin] for now). Instead,
and only when bound to localhost, Elasticsearch will use unicast to contact
the first 5 ports in the `transport.tcp.port` range, which defaults to
`9300-9400`.

This preserves the zero-config auto-clustering experience for the developer,
but it means that you will have to provide a list of <<unicast,unicast hosts>>
when moving to production, for instance:

[source,yaml]
---------------------
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ 192.168.1.2,  192.168.1.3 ]
---------------------

You don’t need to list all of the nodes in your cluster as unicast hosts, but
you should specify at least a quorum (majority) of master-eligible nodes. A
big cluster will typically have three dedicated master nodes, in which case we
recommend listing all three of them as unicast hosts.

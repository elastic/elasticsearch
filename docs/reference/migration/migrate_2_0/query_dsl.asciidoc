=== Query DSL changes

==== Queries and filters merged

Queries and filters have been merged -- all filter clauses are now query
clauses. Instead, query clauses can now be used in _query context_ or in
_filter context_:

Query context::

A query used in query context will caculated relevance scores and will not be
cacheable.  Query context is used whenever filter context does not apply.

Filter context::
+
--

A query used in filter context will not calculate relevance scores, and will
be cacheable. Filter context is introduced by:

* the `constant_score` query
* the `must_not` and (newly added) `filter` parameter in the `bool` query
* the `filter` and `filters` parameters in the `function_score` query
* any API called `filter`, such as the `post_filter` search parameter, or in
  aggregations or index aliases
--

As a result of this change, he `execution` option of the `terms` filter is now
deprecated and ignored if provided.

==== `or` and `and` now implemented via `bool`

The `or` and `and` filters previously had a different execution pattern to the
`bool` filter. It used to be important to use `and`/`or` with certain filter
clauses, and `bool` with others.

This distinction has been removed: the `bool` query is now smart enough to
handle both cases optimally.  As a result of this change, the `or` and `and`
filters are now sugar syntax which are executed internally as a `bool` query.
These filters may be removed in the future.

==== `filtered` query and `query` filter deprecated

The `query` filter is deprecated as is it no longer needed -- all queries can
be used in query or filter context.

The `filtered` query is deprecated in favour of the `bool` query. Instead of
the following:

[source,js]
-------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "text": "quick brown fox"
        }
      },
      "filter": {
        "term": {
          "status": "published"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------------

move the query and filter to the `must` and `filter` parameters in the `bool`
query:

[source,js]
-------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": {
        "match": {
          "text": "quick brown fox"
        }
      },
      "filter": {
        "term": {
          "status": "published"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
-------------------------

==== Filter auto-caching

It used to be possible to control which filters were cached with the `_cache`
option and to provide a custom `_cache_key`.  These options are deprecated
and, if present, will be ignored.

Query clauses used in filter context are now auto-cached when it makes sense
to do so.  The algorithm takes into account the frequency of use, the cost of
query execution, and the cost of building the filter.

The `terms` filter lookup mechanism no longer caches the values of the
document containing the terms.  It relies on the filesystem cache instead. If
the lookup index is not too large, it is recommended to replicate it to all
nodes by setting `index.auto_expand_replicas: 0-all` in order to remove the
network overhead as well.

==== Numeric queries use IDF for scoring

Previously, term queries on numeric fields were deliberately prevented from
using the usual Lucene scoring logic and this behaviour was undocumented and,
to some, unexpected.

Single `term` queries on numeric fields now score in the same way as string
fields, using IDF and norms (if enabled).

To query numeric fields without scoring, the query clause should be used in
filter context, e.g. in the `filter` parameter of the `bool` query, or wrapped
in a `constant_score` query:

[source,js]
----------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": { <1>
            "numeric_tag": 5
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "match": { <2>
            "count": 5
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----------------------------
<1> This clause would include IDF in the relevance score calculation.
<2> This clause would have no effect on the relevance score.

==== Fuzziness and fuzzy-like-this

Fuzzy matching used to calculate the score for each fuzzy alternative, meaning
that rare misspellings would have a higher score than the more common correct
spellings. Now, fuzzy matching blends the scores of all the fuzzy alternatives
to use the IDF of the most frequently occurring alternative.

Fuzziness can no longer be specified using a percentage, but should instead
use the number of allowed edits:

* `0`, `1`, `2`, or
* `AUTO` (which chooses `0`, `1`, or `2` based on the length of the term)

The `fuzzy_like_this` and `fuzzy_like_this_field` queries used a very
expensive approach to fuzzy matching and have been removed.

==== More Like This

The More Like This (`mlt`) API and the `more_like_this_field` (`mlt_field`)
query have been removed in favor of the
<<query-dsl-mlt-query, `more_like_this`>> query.

The parameter `percent_terms_to_match` has been removed in favor of
`minimum_should_match`.

==== `limit` filter deprecated

The `limit` filter is deprecated and becomes a no-op. You can achieve similar
behaviour using the <<search-request-body,terminate_after>> parameter.

==== Java plugins registering custom queries

Java plugins that register custom queries can do so by using the
`IndicesQueriesModule#addQuery(Class<? extends QueryParser>)` method. Other
ways to register custom queries are not supported anymore.

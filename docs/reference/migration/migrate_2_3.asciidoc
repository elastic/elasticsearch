== Breaking changes in 2.3

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 2.3.

[[breaking_23_rest]]
[float]
=== REST API

[float]
==== CORS support broken in 2.3.0 and 2.3.1

A change to the CORS implementation means that CORS support for pre-flight
`OPTIONS` requests is broken in 2.3.0 and 2.3.1.  This is fixed in 2.3.2.

[[breaking_23_index_apis]]
[float]
=== Mappings

[float]
[[_limit_to_the_number_of_literal_nested_literal_fields]]
==== Limit to the number of `nested` fields

Indexing a document with 100 nested fields actually indexes 101 documents as each nested
document is indexed as a separate document. To safeguard against ill-defined mappings
the number of nested fields that can be defined per index has been limited to 50.
This default limit can be changed with the index setting `index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`.
Note that the limit is only checked when new indices are created or mappings are updated. It
will thus only affect existing pre-2.3 indices if their mapping is changed.

[[breaking_23_scripting]]
[float]
=== Scripting

[float]
==== Groovy dependencies

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, the Groovy scripting capabilities
depended on the `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all` artifact.  In addition
to pulling in the Groovy language, this pulls in a very large set of
functionality, none of which is needed for scripting within
Elasticsearch. Aside from the inherent difficulties in managing such a
large set of dependencies, this also increases the surface area for
security issues. This dependency has been reduced to the core Groovy
language `org.codehaus.groovy:groovy` artifact.

=== Analyze API changes

The deprecated `filters`/`token_filters`/`char_filters` parameter has been
renamed `filter`/`token_filter`/`char_filter`.
And `filters`/`token_filters`/`char_filters` has been removed in 5.0.0

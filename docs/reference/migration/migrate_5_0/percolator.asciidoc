=== Percolator changes

==== Percolator is near-real time

Previously percolators were activated in real-time, i.e. as soon as they were
indexed.  Now, changes to the `percolate` query are visible in near-real time,
as soon as the index has been refreshed. This change was required because, in
indices created from 5.0 onwards, the terms used in a percolator query are
automatically indexed to allow for more efficient query selection during
percolation.

==== Percolate and multi percolator APIs

Percolator and multi percolate APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. These APIs have
been replaced by the `percolate` query that can be used in the search and multi search APIs.

==== Percolator field mapping

The `.percolator` type can no longer be used to index percolator queries.

Instead a <<percolator,percolator field type>> must be configured prior to indexing percolator queries.

Indices with a `.percolator` type created on a version before 5.0.0 can still be used,
but new indices no longer accept the `.percolator` type.

==== Percolate document mapping

The `percolate` query no longer modifies the mappings. Before the percolate API
could be used to dynamically introduce new fields to the mappings based on the
fields in the document being percolated. This no longer works, because these
unmapped fields are not persisted in the mapping.

==== Percolator documents returned by search

Documents with the `.percolate` type were previously excluded from the search
response, unless the `.percolate` type was specified explicitly in the search
request.  Now, percolator documents are treated in the same way as any other
document and are returned by search requests.

==== Percolating existing document

When percolating an existing document then also specifying a document as source in the
`percolate` query is not allowed any more. Before the percolate API allowed and ignored
the existing document.

==== Percolate Stats

The percolate stats have been removed. This is because the percolator no longer caches the percolator queries.

==== Java client

The percolator is no longer part of the core elasticsearch dependency. It has moved to the percolator module.
Therefor when using the percolator feature from the Java client the new percolator module should also be on the
classpath. Also the transport client should load the percolator module as plugin:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
TransportClient transportClient = TransportClient.builder()
        .settings(Settings.builder().put("node.name", "node"))
        .addPlugin(PercolatorPlugin.class)
        .build();
transportClient.addTransportAddress(
        new InetSocketTransportAddress(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddresses.forString("127.0.0.1"), 9300))
);
--------------------------------------------------

The percolator and multi percolate related methods from the `Client` interface have been removed. These APIs have been
deprecated and it is recommended to use the `percolate` query in either the search or multi search APIs. However the
percolate and multi percolate APIs can still be used from the Java client.

Using percolate request:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
PercolateRequest request = new PercolateRequest();
// set stuff and then execute:
PercolateResponse response = transportClient.execute(PercolateAction.INSTANCE, request).actionGet();
--------------------------------------------------

Using percolate request builder:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
PercolateRequestBuilder builder = new PercolateRequestBuilder(transportClient, PercolateAction.INSTANCE);
// set stuff and then execute:
PercolateResponse response = builder.get();
--------------------------------------------------

Using multi percolate request:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
MultiPercolateRequest request = new MultiPercolateRequest();
// set stuff and then execute:
MultiPercolateResponse response = transportClient.execute(MultiPercolateAction.INSTANCE, request).get();
--------------------------------------------------

Using multi percolate request builder:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
MultiPercolateRequestBuilder builder = new MultiPercolateRequestBuilder(transportClient, MultiPercolateAction.INSTANCE);
// set stuff and then execute:
MultiPercolateResponse response = builder.get();
--------------------------------------------------

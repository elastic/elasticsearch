=== Default settings are no longer supported
Previous versions of Elasticsearch allowed a user to set a default setting for
any setting. The default setting was only applied if the actual setting was not
already set. This feature was trappy, and the complexity that it introduced was
prone to bugs. Due to this, we have elected to make a breaking change in a
minor release to remove this feature with the exception of `default.path.conf`,
`default.path.data`, and `default.path.logs` which remain to support packaging.
A future version of Elasticsearch will remove support for these as well, so
users should stop relying on this functionality.

=== Checking if indices exist

The endpoint `/{index}` with the verb `HEAD` can be used to check if an index
matching `index` exists (`index` can be a comma-delimited list of index names or
index patterns). This verb behaved differently than `GET` on the same endpoint
in two ways. The first is that sending the same request to `GET` and `HEAD`
could in some cases return different status codes (e.g., `GET
/pattern-that-has-no-matches*` would 200 with an empty response and `HEAD
/pattern-that-has-no-matches*` would 404 with an empty body (and a
`content-length` header of zero). The second is that any `HEAD` request on this
endpoint would return a `content-length` header of zero. Both of these are
violations of the HTTP specification: if `HEAD` is supported, a `HEAD` request
must return the same status code as a `GET` request on the same endpoint would,
and it must return a `content-length` header that is equal to the
`content-length` header as if a `GET` request. This behavior has been addressed
so that `HEAD` always returns the same status code as a `GET` would have, and
with the correct `content-length`. However, this means that `HEAD
/pattern-that-has-no-matches*` which served as an index existence check no
longer 404s, instead 200s as if it was a `GET` request. To obtain the previous
behavior, you must add the parameter `?allow_no_indices=false` (this parameter
defaults to true).

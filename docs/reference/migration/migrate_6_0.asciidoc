== Breaking changes in 6.0

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating
your application to Elasticsearch 6.0.

[float]
=== Indices created before 6.0

Elasticsearch 6.0 can read indices created in version 5.0 or above.  An
Elasticsearch 6.0 node will not start in the presence of indices created in a
version of Elasticsearch before 5.0.

[IMPORTANT]
.Reindex indices from Elasticseach 2.x or before
=========================================

Indices created in Elasticsearch 2.x or before will need to be reindexed with
Elasticsearch 5.x in order to be readable by Elasticsearch 6.x. The easiest
way to reindex old indices is to use the `reindex` API.

=========================================

[IMPORTANT]
.Multiple mapping types are not supported in indices created in 6.0
=========================================

The ability to have multiple mapping types per index has been removed in 6.0.
New indices will be restricted to a single type. This is the first step in the
plan to remove mapping types altogether.  Indices created in 5.x will continue
to support multiple mapping types.

See <<removal-of-types>> for more information.

=========================================

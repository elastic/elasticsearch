=== Java API changes

[float]
[[_literal_setsource_literal_methods_require_xcontenttype]]
==== `setSource` methods require XContentType

Previously the `setSource` methods and other methods that accepted byte/string representations of
an object source did not require the XContentType to be specified. The auto-detection of the content
type is no longer used, so these methods now require the XContentType as an additional argument when
providing the source in bytes or as a string.

[float]
[[_literal_deletebyqueryrequest_literal_requires_an_explicitly_set_query]]
==== `DeleteByQueryRequest` requires an explicitly set query

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, delete by query requests without an explicit query
were accepted, match_all was used as the default query and all documents were deleted
as a result. From version 6.0.0, a `DeleteByQueryRequest` requires an explicit query be set.

[float]
[[_literal_internalstats_literal_and_literal_stats_literal_getcountasstring_method_removed]]
==== `InternalStats` and `Stats` getCountAsString() method removed

The `count` value in the stats aggregation represents a doc count that shouldn't require a formatted
version. This method was deprecated in 5.4 in favour of just using
`String.valueOf(getCount())` if needed

[float]
[[_literal_actionrequestbuilder_execute_literal_returns_literal_actionfuture_literal_rather_than_literal_listenableactionfuture_literal]]
==== `ActionRequestBuilder#execute` returns `ActionFuture` rather than `ListenableActionFuture`

When sending a request through the request builders e.g. client.prepareSearch().execute(), it used to
be possible to call `addListener` against the returned `ListenableActionFuture`. With this change an
`ActionFuture` is returned instead, which is consistent with what the `Client` methods return, hence
it is not possible to associate the future with listeners. The `execute` method that accept a listener
as an argument can be used instead.

[float]
[[_literal_terms_order_literal_and_literal_histogram_order_literal_classes_replace_by_literal_bucketorder_literal]]
==== `Terms.Order` and `Histogram.Order` classes replace by `BucketOrder`

The `terms`, `histogram`, and `date_histogram` aggregation code has been refactored to use common
code for ordering buckets. The `BucketOrder` class must be used instead of `Terms.Order` and
`Histogram.Order`. The `static` methods in the `BucketOrder` class must be called instead of directly
accessing internal order instances, e.g. `BucketOrder.count(boolean)` and `BucketOrder.aggregation(String, boolean)`.
Use `BucketOrder.key(boolean)` to order the `terms` aggregation buckets by `_term`.

[float]
[[_literal_gettookinmillis_literal_removed_in_literal_bulkresponse_literal_literal_searchresponse_literal_and_literal_termvectorsresponse_literal]]
==== `getTookInMillis()` removed in `BulkResponse`, `SearchResponse` and `TermVectorsResponse`

In `BulkResponse`, `SearchResponse` and `TermVectorsResponse` `getTookInMiilis()` method
has been removed in favor of `getTook` method. `getTookInMiilis()` is easily replaced by
`getTook().getMillis()`.

[float]
[[_literal_getfield_literal_and_literal_searchhitfield_literal_replaced_by_literal_documentfield_literal]]
==== `GetField` and `SearchHitField` replaced by `DocumentField`

As `GetField` and `SearchHitField` have the same members, they have been unified into
`DocumentField`.

[float]
==== Some Aggregation classes have moved packages

The classes for the variants of the range aggregation (geo_distance, date and ip) were moved into the `org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.bucket.range`
package.

The `org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.bucket.terms.support` package was removed and the classes were moved to
`org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.bucket.terms`.

The filter aggregation classes were moved to `org.elasticsearch.search.aggregations.bucket.filter`

[float]
[[_constructor_for_literal_percentileranksaggregationbuilder_literal_has_changed]]
==== Constructor for `PercentileRanksAggregationBuilder` has changed

It is now required to include the desired ranks as a non-null, non-empty array of doubles to the builder's constructor,
rather than configuring them via a setter on the builder. The setter method `values()` has correspondingly
been removed.

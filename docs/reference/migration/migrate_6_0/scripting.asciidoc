=== Scripting changes

==== Groovy language removed

The groovy scripting language was deprecated in elasticsearch 5.0 and is now removed.
Use painless instead.

==== Date fields now return dates

`doc.some_date_field.value` now returns `ReadableDateTime`s instead of
milliseconds since epoch as a `long`. The same is true for
`doc.some_date_field[some_number]`. Use `doc.some_date_field.value.millis` to
fetch the milliseconds since epoch if you need it.

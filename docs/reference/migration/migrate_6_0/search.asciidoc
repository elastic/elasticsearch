=== Search and Query DSL changes

==== Changes to queries

* The `collect_payloads` parameter of the `span_near` query has been removed. Payloads will be
  loaded when needed.

* Queries on boolean fields now strictly parse boolean-like values. This means
  only the strings `"true"` and `"false"` will be parsed into their boolean
  counterparts. Other strings will cause an error to be thrown.


==== Search shards API

The search shards API no longer accepts the `type` url parameter, which didn't
have any effect in previous versions.

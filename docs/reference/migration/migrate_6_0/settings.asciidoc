=== Settings changes

==== Snapshot settings

The internal setting `cluster.routing.allocation.snapshot.relocation_enabled` that allowed shards with running snapshots to be reallocated to
different nodes has been removed. Enabling this setting could cause allocation issues if a shard got allocated off a node and then
reallocated back to this node while a snapshot was running.

==== Store throttling settings

Store throttling has been removed. As a consequence, the
`indices.store.throttle.type` and `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`
cluster settings and the `index.store.throttle.type` and
`index.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` index settings are not
recognized anymore.

==== Store settings

The `default` `index.store.type` has been removed. If you were using it, we
advise that you simply remove it from your index settings and Elasticsearch
will use the best `store` implementation for your operating system.

==== Network settings

The blocking tcp client, blocking tcp server, and blocking http server have been removed.
As a consequence, the `network.tcp.blocking_server`, `network.tcp.blocking_client`,
`network.tcp.blocking`,`transport.tcp.blocking_client`, `transport.tcp.blocking_server`,
and `http.tcp.blocking_server` settings are not recognized anymore.

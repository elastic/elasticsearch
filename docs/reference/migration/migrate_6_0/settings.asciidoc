=== Settings changes

==== Snapshot settings

The internal setting `cluster.routing.allocation.snapshot.relocation_enabled` that allowed shards with running snapshots to be reallocated to
different nodes has been removed. Enabling this setting could cause allocation issues if a shard got allocated off a node and then
reallocated back to this node while a snapshot was running.

your application to Elasticsearch 6.4.

[[breaking_64_api_changes]]
=== API changes

==== Field capabilities request format

In the past, `fields` could be provided either as a parameter, or as part of the request
body. Specifying `fields` in the request body is now deprecated, and instead they should
always be supplied through a request parameter. In 7.0.0, the field capabilities API will
not accept `fields` supplied in the request body.

[[copy-source-settings-on-resize]]
==== Copying source settings during shrink/split operations

In prior versions of Elasticsearch, resize operations (shrink/split) would only
copy `index.analysis`, `index.similarity`, and `index.sort` settings from the
source index. Elasticsearch 6.4.0 introduces a request parameter `copy_settings`
which will copy all index settings from the source except for non-copyable index
settings. This parameter defaults to `false` in 6.x, is immediately deprecated
in 6.4.0, will only be able to be set to `true` in 8.x, and will be removed in
9.0.0. Note than when this parameter is used it means that all copyable settings
will be copied; this includes the index blocks that must be put in place for a
resize operation, and any allocation settings put in place in preparation for
executing the resize operation. If you use this parameter, you will either have
to follow up the operation with a request to adjust to the desired settings on
the target index, or send the desired value of these settings with the resize
operation.

[[breaking_64_search_changes]]
=== Search and query DSL changes

==== Limiting the length of regex that can be used in a Regexp Query request

Executing a <<query-dsl-regexp-query,Regexp Query>> with a long regex string may 
degrade search performance. To safeguard against this, the maximum length of 
regex that can be used in a Regexp Query request has been limited to 1000. This 
default maximum can be changed for a particular index with the index setting 
`index.max_regex_length`.

[[breaking_64_scripting_changes]]
=== Scripting

==== Legacy stored script formats have been deprecated

Stored script formats that don't use top level `script` object have been deprecated and
support for these formats will be removed in the next major release.

This includes `template` stored scripts format and
formats that do not encapsulate the script inside a `script` json object.

[[breaking_64_rest_client_changes]]
=== REST Client

==== Old low level ++performRequest++s deprecated
The versions of `performRequest` and `performRequestAsync` that were in the
low level client in 6.3 have been deprecated in favor of
`performRequest(Request)` and `performRequestAsync(Request, ActionListener)`.
These will allow us to add more features to the client without adding more
variants of `performRequest`.

==== Old high level request methods deprecated
All request methods on the high level client have been deprecated in favor
of a new variant that takes `RequestOptions`. This allows users of the high
level client to customize many options on individual requests that were not
available otherwise.

==== HostSniffer renamed to NodeSniffer and signature changed
To provide allow the `Sniffer` to pick up more metadata we changed it from
sniffing ++HttpHost++s to sniffing ++Node++s, a new class introduced to contain
both connection information and metadata like the node's role or any
attributes defined in elasticsearch.yml. These can be used by the new
`RequestOptions#setNodeSelector`.

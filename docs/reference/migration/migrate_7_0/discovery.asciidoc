=== Discovery changes

[float]
==== Cluster bootstrapping is required if discovery is configured

The first time a cluster is started, `cluster.initial_master_nodes` must be set
to perform cluster bootstrapping. It should contain the names of the
master-eligible nodes in the initial cluster and be defined on every
master-eligible node in the cluster. See <<discovery-settings,the discovery
settings summary>> for an example, and the
<<modules-discovery-bootstrap-cluster,cluster bootstrapping reference
documentation>> describes this setting in more detail.

The `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` setting is permitted, but ignored, on
7.x nodes.

[float]
==== Removing master-eligible nodes sometimes requires voting exclusions

If you wish to remove half or more of the master-eligible nodes from a cluster,
you must first exclude the affected nodes from the voting configuration using
the <<modules-discovery-adding-removing-nodes,voting config exclusions API>>.
If you remove fewer than half of the master-eligible nodes at the same time,
voting exclusions are not required.  If you remove only master-ineligible nodes
such as data-only nodes or coordinating-only nodes, voting exclusions are not
required. Likewise, if you add nodes to the cluster, voting exclusions are not
required.

==== Discovery configuration is required in production

Production deployments of Elasticsearch now require at least one of the
following settings to be specified in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration
file:

- `discovery.seed_hosts`
- `discovery.seed_providers`
- `cluster.initial_master_nodes`

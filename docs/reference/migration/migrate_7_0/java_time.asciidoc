=== Replacing Joda-Time with java time

Since Java 8 there is a dedicated `java.time` package, which is superior to
the Joda-Time library, that has been used so far in Elasticsearch. One of
the biggest advantages is the ability to be able to store dates in a higher
resolution than milliseconds for greater precision. Also this will allow us
to remove the Joda-Time dependency in the future.

The mappings, aggregations and search code switched from Joda-Time to
java time.

==== Joda based date formatters are replaced with java ones

With the release of Elasticsearch 6.7 a backwards compatibility layer was
introduced, that checked if you are using a Joda-Time based formatter, that is
supported differently in java time. A log message was emitted, and you could
create the proper java time based formatter prefixed with an `8`.

With Elasticsearch 7.0 all formatters are now java based, which means you will
get exceptions when using deprecated formatters without checking the
deprecation log in 6.7. In the worst case you may even end up with different
dates.

An example deprecation message looks like this, that is returned, when you
try to use a date formatter that includes a lower case `Y`

[source,text]
----------
Use of 'Y' (year-of-era) will change to 'y' in the next major version of
Elasticsearch. Prefix your date format with '8' to use the new specifier.
----------

So, instead of using `YYYY.MM.dd` you should use `8yyyy.MM.dd`.

You can find more information about available formatting strings in the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html[DateTimeFormatter javadocs].

[float]
==== Date formats behavioural change

The `epoch_millis` and `epoch_second` formatters no longer support
scientific notation.

If you are using the century of era formatter in a date (`C`), this will no
longer be supported.

The year-of-era formatting character is a `Y` in Joda-Time, but a lowercase
`y` in java time.

The week-based-year formatting character is a lowercase `x` in Joda-Time,
but an upper-case `Y` in java time.

[float]
==== Using time zones in the Java client

Timezones have to be specified as java time based zone objects. This means,
instead of using a `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone` the use of
`java.time.ZoneId` is required.

Examples of possible uses are the `QueryStringQueryBuilder`, the
`RangeQueryBuilder` or the `DateHistogramAggregationBuilder`, each of them
allow for an optional timezone for that part of the search request.

[float]
==== Parsing aggregation buckets in the Java client

The date based aggregation buckets in responses used to be of
type `JodaTime`. Due to migrating to java-time, the buckets are now of
type `ZonedDateTime`. As the client is returning untyped objects here, you
may run into class cast exceptions only when running the code, but not at
compile time, ensure you have proper test coverage for this in your
own code.

==== Parsing `GMT0` timezone with JDK8 is not supported

When you are running Elasticsearch 7 with Java 8, you are not able to parse
the timezone `GMT0` properly anymore. The reason for this is a bug in the
JDK, which has not been fixed for JDK8. You can read more in the
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8138664[official issue]
The fix is in JDK version 9 and newer.

[float]
==== Scripting with dates should use java time based methods

If dates are used in scripting, a backwards compatibility layer has been added
that emulates the Joda-Time methods, but logs a deprecation message as well
to use the java time methods.

The following methods will be removed in future versions of Elasticsearch
and should be replaced.

* `getDayOfWeek()` will be an enum instead of an int, if you need to use
  an int, use `getDayOfWeekEnum().getValue()`
* `getMillis()` should be replaced with `toInstant().toEpochMilli()`
* `getCenturyOfEra()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA) / 100`
* `getEra()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.ERA)`
* `getHourOfDay()` should be replaced with `getHour()`
* `getMillisOfDay()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_DAY)`
* `getMillisOfSecond()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND)`
* `getMinuteOfDay()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.MINUTE_OF_DAY)`
* `getMinuteOfHour()` should be replaced with `getMinute()`
* `getMonthOfYear()` should be replaced with `getMonthValue()`
* `getSecondOfDay()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.SECOND_OF_DAY)`
* `getSecondOfMinute()` should be replaced with `getSecond()`
* `getWeekOfWeekyear()` should be replaced with `get(WeekFields.ISO.weekOfWeekBasedYear())`
* `getWeekyear()` should be replaced with `get(WeekFields.ISO.weekBasedYear())`
* `getYearOfCentury()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA) % 100`
* `getYearOfEra()` should be replaced with `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA)`
* `toString(String)` should be replaced with a `DateTimeFormatter`
* `toString(String,Locale)` should be replaced with a `DateTimeFormatter`

[float]
==== Negative epoch timestamps are no longer supported

With the switch to java time, support for negative timestamps has been removed.
For dates before 1970, use a date format containing a year.

=== Snapshot stats changes

Snapshot stats details are provided in a new structured way:

* `total` section for all the files that are referenced by the snapshot.
* `incremental` section for those files that actually needed to be copied over as part of the incremental snapshotting.
* In case of a snapshot that's still in progress, there's also a `processed` section for files that are in the process of being copied.

==== Deprecated `number_of_files`, `processed_files`, `total_size_in_bytes` and `processed_size_in_bytes` snapshot stats properties have been removed

* Properties `number_of_files` and `total_size_in_bytes` are removed and should be replaced by values of nested object `total`.
* Properties `processed_files` and `processed_size_in_bytes` are removed and should be replaced by values of nested object `processed`.

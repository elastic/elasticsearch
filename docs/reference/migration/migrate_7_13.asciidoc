==== Security deprecations

[[implicitly-disabled-basic-realms]]
Currently, the file and native realms have following implicit behaviours:

* If file and native realms are not configured, they are implicitly disabled
if there are other explicitly configured realms.
* If no realm is available due to either unconfigured, explicitly disabled
or disallowed by the license, the file and native realms are always enabled
even when they are explicitly disabled.

Both of the above behaviours are deprecated. In version 8.0.0, the file and
native realms will always be enabled unless explicitly disabled. If they are
explicitly disabled, they remain disabled at all times.

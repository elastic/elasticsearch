[[breaking-changes-7.13]]
=== Breaking changes

The following changes in {es} 7.13 might affect your applications
and prevent them from operating normally.
Before upgrading to 7.13, review these changes and take the described steps
to mitigate the impact.

NOTE: Breaking changes introduced in minor versions are
normally limited to security and bug fixes.
Significant changes in behavior are deprecated in a minor release and
the old behavior is supported until the next major release.
To find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,
enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.

[[breaking_713_mapping_changes]]
==== Mapping changes

[[geo-mappers-external-values]]
.Geo mappers no longer accept external values from multifields.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In earlier versions, geo fields could theoretically be used as a subfield
if their parent field set a geometry object as an external value during
parsing. This functionality was unused within the {es} codebase and
blocked required changes to allow index-time scripts on `geo_point` fields,
so it has been removed.
====

[[geo-point-geohash-subfields]]
.Geopoint mappers pass geohashes to subfields one-by-one.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In earlier versions, a multiply-valued geopoint field would pass
its values as geohashes to subfields by combining them in to a single
comma-delimited string. These are now passed one-by-one as single
geohash strings.
====

[[deprecated-7.13]]
=== Deprecations

The following functionality has been deprecated in {es} 7.13
and will be removed in 8.0.
While this won't have an immediate impact on your applications,
we strongly encourage you take the described steps to update your code
after upgrading to 7.13.

NOTE: Significant changes in behavior are deprecated in a minor release and
the old behavior is supported until the next major release.
To find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,
enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.

[[breaking_713_agg_deprecations]]
==== Aggregation deprecations

[discrete]
[[breaking_713_boolean-field-support-deprecated-date-aggs]]
.Date aggregations on `boolean` fields are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Support for auto-interval date histogram, date histogram, and date range
aggregations on `boolean` fields is now deprecated. On `boolean` fields, these
aggregations are rarely useful and often unintended.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_713_infra_core_deprecations]]
==== Core deprecations

[[multiple-data-path-support-deprecated]]
.Multiple data path support is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Support for multiple paths in the `path.data` setting is now deprecated. We
introduced this option as a way to support multi-disk setups. It has since been
a source of user complaints due to confusing and unintuitive behavior.

*Impact* +
Specify a single path in `path.data`. To use multiple disks, use a RAID
hardware configuration or similar hardware solution.
====

[[action-destructive-defaults-to-true]]
.The `action.destructive_requires_name` setting will default to `true` in 8.0.0.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 8.0.0, the `action.destructive_requires_name` setting will default to `true`.
Currently, the setting defaults to `false`.

*Impact* +
If you use a wildcard (`*`) or `_all` to delete indices or perform other
destructive actions, use the {ref}/cluster-update-settings.html[update cluster
settings API] to set `action.destructive_requires_name` to `false` to avoid
errors in 8.0.0.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_713_eql_deprecations]]
==== EQL deprecations

[[wildcard-function-deprecated]]
.The `wildcard` function is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Impact* +
Use the <<eql-syntax-pattern-comparison-keywords,`like`>> or
<<eql-syntax-pattern-comparison-keywords,`regex`>> keyword instead.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_713_security_changes]]
==== Security deprecations

[[implicitly-disabled-basic-realms]]
.Implicit enablement of the file and native realms is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Currently, the file and native realms have the following implicit behaviors:

* If file and native realms are not configured, they are implicitly disabled
if there are other explicitly configured realms.
* If no realm is available because realms are unconfigured, explicitly
disabled, or not allowed by your license, the file and native realms are always
enabled, even if explicitly disabled.

*Impact* +
Both of the above behaviors are deprecated. In 8.0.0, the file and
native realms will always be enabled unless explicitly disabled. If they are
explicitly disabled, they remain disabled at all times.

=== Breaking changes

The following changes in {es} 7.14 might affect your applications
and prevent them from operating normally.
Before upgrading to 7.13, review these changes and take the described steps
to mitigate the impact.

NOTE: Breaking changes introduced in minor versions are
normally limited to security and bug fixes.
Significant changes in behavior are deprecated in a minor release and
the old behavior is supported until the next major release.
To find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,
enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.

==== Security deprecations

[[implicitly-disabled-security]]
Currently, security features are disabled when operating on a basic or trial
license when `xpack.security.enabled` has not been explicitly set.

This behavior is now deprecated. In version 8.0.0, security features will be
enabled by default for all licenses, unless explicitly disabled (by setting
`xpack.security.enabled: false`).

[[breaking-changes-7.16]]
=== Breaking changes

The following changes in {es} 7.16 might affect your applications
and prevent them from operating normally.
Before upgrading to 7.16, review these changes and take the described steps
to mitigate the impact.

NOTE: Breaking changes introduced in minor versions are
normally limited to security and bug fixes.
Significant changes in behavior are deprecated in a minor release and
the old behavior is supported until the next major release.
To find out if you are using any deprecated functionality,
enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.

[[breaking_716_settings_changes]]
==== Settings changes

[[breaking_716_disk_threshold_enabled_operator_only]]
.Disk threshold enabled setting is operator only
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Orchestrated environments such as {ess} and Elastic Cloud Enterprise rely on
the {ref}/modules-cluster.html#cluster-routing-disk-threshold[disk thresholds]
in {es} to operate the cluster correctly. For example the disk thresholds help
determine how large an auto-scaled cluster should be. Disabling these disk
thresholds prevents the orchestration system from working correctly, so starting
in 7.16.0 the `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled` setting is an
{ref}/operator-only-functionality.html#operator-only-dynamic-cluster-settings[operator only]
setting which cannot be changed by end-users.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of this setting in orchestrated environments such as {ess} and
Elastic Cloud Enterprise. Contact the environment administrator for help with
disk space management if needed.
+
This change has no impact on users outside of orchestrated environments.

[[deprecated-7.16]]
=== Deprecations

The following functionality has been deprecated in {es} 7.16 and will be removed
in 8.0. While this won't have an immediate impact on your applications, we
strongly encourage you take the described steps to update your code after
upgrading to 7.16.

NOTE: Significant changes in behavior are deprecated in a minor release and the
old behavior is supported until the next major release. To find out if you are
using any deprecated functionality, enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation
logging>>.

[[breaking_716_tls_changes]]
==== Security changes

[[saml-realm-nameid-changes]]
.The `nameid_format` SAML realm setting no longer has a default value.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In SAML, Identity Providers (IdPs) can either be explicitly configured to
release a `NameID` with a specific format, or configured to attempt to conform 
with the requirements of a Service Provider (SP). The SP declares its
requirements in the `NameIDPolicy` element of a SAML Authentication Request.
In {es}, the `nameid_format` SAML realm setting controls the `NameIDPolicy`
value.
Previously, the default value for `nameid_format` was
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`. This setting created
authentication requests that required the IdP to release `NameID` with a
`transient` format.
The default value has been removed, which means that {es} will create SAML Authentication Requests by default that don't put this requirement on the
IdP. If you want to retain the previous behavior, set `nameid_format` to
`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`.

*Impact* +
If you currently don't configure `nameid_format` explicitly, it's possible
that your IdP will reject authentication requests from {es} because the requests 
do not specify a `NameID` format (and your IdP is configured to expect one).
This mismatch can result in a broken SAML configuration. If you're unsure whether 
your IdP is explicitly configured to use a certain `NameID` format and you want to retain current behavior
, try setting `nameid_format` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient` explicitly.
====

[[tls-ssl-transport-enabled-required]]
.The `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` setting will be required to configure `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Configuring any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.transport.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` generates warnings in the deprecation
log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, either:

* Explicitly set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions to
{ref}/security-basic-setup.html#encrypt-internode-communication[encrypt internode communications with TLS]. As part of this configuration, explicitly set
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `true`.

For example:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

[[tls-ssl-http-enabled-required]]
.The `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` setting will be required to configure `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Configuring any SSL settings for `xpack.security.http.ssl` without also
configuring `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` generates warnings in the
deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, either:

* Explicitly set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions to
{ref}/security-basic-setup-https.html#encrypt-http-communication[encrypt HTTP client communications for {es}]. As part
of this configuration, explicitly set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`
as `true`.

For example:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

[[tls-ssl-transport-cert-required]]
.A `xpack.security.transport.ssl` certificate and key will be required to enable SSL for the transport interface.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Enabling SSL for the transport interface without also configuring a certificate
and key through use of the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings generates warnings in the
deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration will result in errors.

*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a
certificate and key using the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings. If a certificate and key is not
provided, {es} will generate warnings in the deprecation log.
====

[[tls-ssl-http-cert-required]]
.A `xpack.security.http.ssl` certificate and key will be required to enable SSL for the HTTP layer.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Enabling SSL for the HTTP layer without also configuring a certificate and key
through use of the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path` setting or
the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.key`
settings generates warnings in the deprecation log. In 8.0, this configuration
will result in errors.

*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a
certificate and key using the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.http.ssl.key` settings. If a certificate and key is not
provided, {es} will generate warnings in the deprecation log.

[[breaking_716_ilm_changes]]
==== {ilm-cap} ({ilm-init}) changes

[[ilm-freeze-noop]]
.The ILM `freeze` action has been deprecated and will be a no-op in a future release.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The ILM freeze action is now deprecated. This is because frozen indices provide no benefit given improvements in heap memory
utilization. In 8.0 the freeze action will be a no-op and perform no action on the index, as the freeze API endpoint
has been removed in 8.0.

*Impact* +
Update your ILM policies to remove the `freeze` action from the `cold` phase.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_716_monitoring_changes]]
==== Monitoring deprecations

[[monitoring-use-ingest-setting-deprecation]]
.The `use_ingest` setting on Monitoring exporter configurations is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.use_ingest` property has been deprecated in 7.16.0 and
will be removed in 8.0.0. This parameter controls the creation of pipelines for monitoring
indices. These pipelines currently have no function.

*Impact* +
Discontinue the use of the `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.use_ingest` setting
as it will no longer be recognized in the next major release.
====

[[monitoring-pipeline-master-timeout-setting-deprecation]]
.The `index.pipeline.master_timeout` setting on Monitoring HTTP exporter configurations is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.index.pipeline.master_timeout` property has been
deprecated in 7.16.0. This parameter sets the timeout when waiting for the remote
Monitoring cluster to create pipelines. These pipelines for monitoring indices currently
have no function and will be removed in 8.0.0.

*Impact* +
Discontinue the use of the `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.index.pipeline.master_timeout` setting
as it will no longer be recognized in the next major release.
====

[[monitoring-template-create-legacy-setting-deprecation]]
.The `index.template.create_legacy_templates` setting on Monitoring HTTP exporter configurations is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.index.template.create_legacy_templates` property has been
deprecated in 7.16.0. This parameter instructs the exporter to install the previous version
of monitoring templates on the monitoring cluster. These older templates were meant to assist
in transitioning to the current monitoring data format. They are currently empty and are no
longer of any use.

*Impact* +
Discontinue the use of the `xpack.monitoring.exporters.*.index.template.create_legacy_templates` setting
as it will no longer be recognized in the next major release.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_716_settings_deprecations]]
==== Settings deprecations

[[deprecate-transient-cluster-settings]]
.Transient cluster settings are now deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Transient cluster settings are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This is because transient
cluster settings have an unpredictable lifecycle. Transient cluster settings do not survive full cluster restarts or
cluster instability. In these cases, {es} recovers the cluster state
from persistent storage, effectively erasing the transient settings. The loss of transient settings can happen
unexpectedly, leading to a potentially undesired cluster configuration.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of transient settings when modifying
your cluster settings through the `PUT _cluster/settings` REST API. Use persistent
settings instead. See the
{ref}/transient-settings-migration-guide.html[Transient settings migration
guide]. 
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_716_cluster_deprecations]]
==== Cluster deprecations

[[deprecate-cluster-health-408]]
.Distinguishing cluster health timeout status by HTTP response code is now deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The {ref}/cluster-health.html[cluster health API] includes options for waiting
for certain health conditions to be satisfied. If the requested conditions are
not satisfied within a timeout then {es} will send back a normal response
including the field `"timed_out": true`. In earlier versions it would also use
the HTTP response code `408 Request timeout` if the request timed out, and `200
OK` otherwise. The `408 Request timeout` response code is not appropriate for
this situation and its use is deprecated. Future versions will use the response
code `200 OK` for both cases.

*Impact* +
Update your application to read the `"timed_out"` field of the response instead
of the HTTP response code to determine whether the request timed out or not. To
avoid deprecation warnings and opt into the future behaviour, include the query
parameter `?return_200_for_cluster_health_timeout` in your request.
====

[[script-context-cache-deprecated]]
.The script context cache is deprecated
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Setting `script.max_compilations_rate` to `use-context` and
configuring context-specific caches is deprecated.

Context-specific caches are no longer needed to prevent system scripts
from triggering rate limits.

Configure the general cache to control the max compilation rate, cache size, and
cache expiration for your scripts.

*Impact* +
Remove `script.max_compilations_rate: use-context` and the context-specific cache
settings: `script.context.$CONTEXT.cache_max_size`,
`script.context.$CONTEXT.max_compilations_rate`, `script.context.$CONTEXT.cache_expire`.

The general cache defaults to a max size of 3000 with a rate limit of 150/5m,
which allows 150 compilations per 5 minute period.  By default, the entries in the
cache do not expire.

To override the defaults, configure the `script.cache.max_size`,
`script.max_compilations_rate`, and `script.cache.expire` settings.

[[deprecations_717_cluster_and_node_setting]]
==== Cluster and node setting deprecations

[[deprecation_for_truststores_with_no_trust_entries]]
.Deprecation for truststores with no trust entries
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The use of SSL truststores that do not contain any trusted entries has been deprecated.
The various `*.ssl.truststore.path` settings (for example
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path` or `xpack.http.ssl.truststore.path`) can
be used to configure a set of "trust anchors" for SSL certificate verification. In {es}
version 7 and earlier, it was permitted to configure a truststore that did not contain
any trust anchors (that is, it was empty, or it contained "private key" entries only).
In {es} version 8 and above, a `truststore.path` without any trusted certificate entries
is no longer accepted, and will cause an error. This configuration is now deprecated in
{es} version 7.17

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, remove any SSL truststores that do not
contain any trusted entries.
====

[[deprecation_for_dls_settings]]
.Deprecation for DLS settings
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Two settings available in the latest versions of 7.17 are not available in the next major version.
Newer versions of 7.17 default to stricter Document Level Security (DLS) rules and the follow
settings can be used to disable those stricter DLS rules:
`xpack.security.dls.force_terms_aggs_to_exclude_deleted_docs.enabled` and
`xpack.security.dls.error_when_validate_query_with_rewrite.enabled`.
Newer versions, of next major version of {es}, also default to the stricter DLS rules but don't allow
usage of the less strict rules.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, remove these settings from elasticsearch.yml.

[[deprecations_717_mapping]]
==== Mapping deprecations

[[camel_case_date_formats_are_deprecated]]
.Camel case date formats are deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The use of camel case patterns on date formats is deprecated and will be removed
in {es} 8.0.0.

The corresponding snake case pattern should be used instead.

To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the camel case pattern.

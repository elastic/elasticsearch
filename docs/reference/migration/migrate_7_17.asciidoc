[[deprecations_717_cluster_and_node_setting]]
==== Cluster and node setting deprecations

[[deprecation_for_truststores_with_no_trust_entries]]
.Deprecation for truststores with no trust entries
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The use of SSL truststores that do not contain any trusted entries has been deprecated.
The various `*.ssl.truststore.path` settings (for example
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path` or `xpack.http.ssl.truststore.path`) can
be used to configure a set of "trust anchors" for SSL certificate verification. In {es}
version 7 and earlier, it was permitted to configure a truststore that did not contain
any trust anchors (that is, it was empty, or it contained "private key" entries only).
In {es} version 8 and above, a `truststore.path` without any trusted certificate entries
is no longer accepted, and will cause an error. This configuration is now deprecated in
{es} version 7.17

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, remove any SSL truststores that do not
contain any trusted entries.

[%collapsible]

in {es} 8.0.0.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, discontinue use of the camel case pattern.

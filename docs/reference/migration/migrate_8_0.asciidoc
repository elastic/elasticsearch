[[breaking_80_cluster_node_setting_deprecations]]
==== Cluster and node setting deprecations

[[deprecate-transient-cluster-settings]]
.We no longer recommend using transient cluster settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
We no longer recommend using transient cluster settings. Use persistent cluster
settings instead. If a cluster becomes unstable, transient settings can clear
unexpectedly, resulting in an undesired cluster configuration.

*Impact* +
Transient cluster settings are not yet deprecated, but we plan to deprecate them
in a future release. For migration steps, see the
{ref}/transient-settings-migration-guide.html[Transient settings migration
guide].

[[breaking_80_command_line_tool_deprecations]]
==== Command line tool deprecations

TIP: {ess-skip-section}

[[deprecate-elasticsearch-setup-passwords]]
.The `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` tool is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` tool is deprecated in 8.0. To
manually reset the password for built-in users (including the `elastic` user), use
the {ref}/reset-password.html[`elasticsearch-reset-password`] tool, the {es}
{ref}/security-api-change-password.html[change passwords API], or the
User Management features in {kib}.
`elasticsearch-setup-passwords` will be removed in a future release.

*Impact* +
Passwords are generated automatically for the `elastic` user when you start {es} for the first time. If you run `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` after
starting {es}, it will fail because the `elastic`
user password is already configured.

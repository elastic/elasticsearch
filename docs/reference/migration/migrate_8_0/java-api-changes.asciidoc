[[ilm-hlrc-rename]]
.The `indexlifecycle` package has been renamed `ilm` in the Java High Level REST Client.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In the high level REST client, the `indexlifecycle` package has been
renamed to `ilm` to match the package rename inside the {es} code.

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to use the `ilm` package in place of
`indexlifecycle`.
====

.Changes to `Fuzziness`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To create `Fuzziness` instances, use the `fromString` and `fromEdits` method
instead of the `build` method that used to accept both Strings and numeric
values. Several fuzziness setters on query builders (e.g.
MatchQueryBuilder#fuzziness) now accept only a `Fuzziness` instance instead of
an Object.

Fuzziness used to be lenient when it comes to parsing arbitrary numeric values
while silently truncating them to one of the three allowed edit distances 0, 1
or 2. This leniency is now removed and the class will throw errors when trying
to construct an instance with another value (e.g. floats like 1.3 used to get
accepted but truncated to 1).

*Impact* +
Use the available constants (e.g. `Fuzziness.ONE`, `Fuzziness.AUTO`) or build
your own instance using the above mentioned factory methods. Use only allowed
`Fuzziness` values.
====

.Changes to `Repository`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Repository has no dependency on IndexShard anymore. The contract of restoreShard
and snapshotShard has been reduced to Store and MappingService in order to improve
testability.

*Impact* +
No action needed.

.The `network.tcp.connect_timeout` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `network.tcp.connect_timeout` setting was deprecated in 7.x and has been removed in 8.0. This setting
was a fallback setting for `transport.connect_timeout`.

*Impact* +
Use the `transport.connect_timeout` setting to change the default connection
timeout for client connections. Discontinue use of the
`network.tcp.connect_timeout` setting. Specifying the
`network.tcp.connect_timeout` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an
error on startup.

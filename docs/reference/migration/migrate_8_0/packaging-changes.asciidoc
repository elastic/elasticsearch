.The layout of the data folder has changed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Each node's data is now stored directly in the data directory set by the
`path.data` setting, rather than in `${path.data}/nodes/0`, because the removal
of the `node.max_local_storage_nodes` setting means that nodes may no longer
share a data path.

*Impact* +
At startup, {es} will automatically migrate the data path to the new layout.
This automatic migration will not proceed if the data path contains data for
more than one node. You should move to a configuration in which each node has
its own data path before upgrading.

If you try to upgrade a configuration in which there is data for more than one
node in a data path then the automatic migration will fail and {es}
will refuse to start. To resolve this you will need to perform the migration
manually. The data for the extra nodes are stored in folders named
`${path.data}/nodes/1`, `${path.data}/nodes/2` and so on, and you should move
each of these folders to an appropriate location and then configure the
corresponding node to use this location for its data path. If your nodes each
have more than one data path in their `path.data` settings then you should move
all the corresponding subfolders in parallel. Each node uses the same subfolder
(e.g. `nodes/2`) across all its data paths.

.The default Maxmind geoip databases have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The default Maxmind geoip databases that shipped by default with Elasticsearch
have been removed. These databases are out dated and stale and using these
databases will likely result in incorrect geoip lookups.

By default since 7.13, these pre-packaged geoip databases
were used in case no database were specified in the config directory or before
the geoip downloader downloaded the geoip databases. When the geoip database
downloader completed downloading the new databases then these pre-packaged
databases were no longer used.

*Impact* +
If the geoip downloader is disabled and no geoip databases are provided
in the config directory of each ingest node then the geoip processor will
no longer perform geoip lookups and tag these documents with the fact that
the requested database is no longer available.

After a cluster has been started and before the geoip downloader has completed
downloading the most up to data databases, the geoip processor will not perform
any geoip lookups and tag documents that the requested database is not available.
After the geoip downloader has completed downloading the most up to data databases
then the geoip processor will function as normal. The window of time that the
geoip processor can't do geoip lookups after cluster startup should be very small.

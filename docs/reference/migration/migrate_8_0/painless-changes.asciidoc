.The `JodaCompatibleZonedDateTime` class has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
As a transition from Joda datetime to Java datetime, scripting used
an intermediate class called `JodaCompatibleZonedDateTime`. This class
has been removed and is replaced by `ZonedDateTime`. Any use of casting
to a `JodaCompatibleZonedDateTime` or use of method calls only available
in `JodaCompatibleZonedDateTime` in a script will result in a compilation
error, and may not allow the upgraded node to start.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading, replace `getDayOfWeek` with `getDayOfWeekEnum().value` in any
scripts. Any use of `getDayOfWeek` expecting a return value of `int` will result
in a compilation error or runtime error and may not allow the upgraded node to
start.

The following `JodaCompatibleZonedDateTime` methods must be replaced using
`ZonedDateTime` methods prior to upgrade:

* `getMillis()` -> `toInstant().toEpochMilli()`
* `getCenturyOfEra()` -> `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA) / 100`
* `getEra()` -> `get(ChronoField.ERA)`
* `getHourOfDay()` -> `getHour()`
* `getMillisOfDay()` -> `get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_DAY)`
* `getMillisOfSecond()` -> `get(ChronoField.MILLI_OF_SECOND)`
* `getMinuteOfDay()` -> `get(ChronoField.MINUTE_OF_DAY)`
* `getMinuteOfHour()` -> `getMinute()`
* `getMonthOfYear()` -> `getMonthValue()`
* `getSecondOfDay()` -> `get(ChronoField.SECOND_OF_DAY)`
* `getSecondOfMinute()` -> `getSecond()`
* `getWeekOfWeekyear()` -> `get(IsoFields.WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR)`
* `getWeekyear()` -> `get(IsoFields.WEEK_BASED_YEAR)`
* `getYearOfCentury()` -> `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA) % 100`
* `getYearOfEra()` -> `get(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA)`
* `toString(String)` -> a DateTimeFormatter
* `toString(String, Locale)` -> a DateTimeFormatter

TIP: {ess-skip-section}

.The S3, GCS and Azure repository plugins are now included in Elasticsearch
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In previous versions of {es}, in order to register a snapshot repository
backed by Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or Microsoft Azure Blob
Storage, you first had to install the corresponding Elasticsearch plugin,
for example `repository-s3`. These plugins are now included in {es} by
default.

*Impact* +
You no longer need to install the following plugins, and not should attempt
to do so.

* `repository-azure`
* `repository-gcs`
* `repository-s3`

{es} and the `elasticsearch-plugin` CLI tool have been changed to tolerate
attempted installation and removal of these plugins in order to avoid
breaking any existing automation. In the future, attempting to install
these plugins will be an error.

Specifically, the `elasticsearch-plugin` CLI tool will not fail if you
attempt to install any of the above plugins, and will instead print a
warning and skip the plugins. If any of these plugins are already
installed, for example because you installed them when running an older
version of {es}, then you can still remove them with
`elasticsearch-plugin`. Attempting to remove them if they are not installed
will succeed but print a warnings.

If you run {es} using Docker and you are managing plugins using a
{plugins}/manage-plugins-using-configuration-file.html[configuration file], then when
{es} first starts after you upgrade it, it will remove the above plugins if
they already installed. If any of these plugins are specified in your
configuration file, {es} will ignore them and emit a warning log message.
====

.Third party plugins can no longer intercept REST requests (`RestHandlerWrapper`)
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In previous versions of {es}, third-party plugins could implement the 
`getRestHandlerWrapper` method to intercept all REST requests to the node. A 
common use of this feature was to implement custom security plugins to replace
the built-in {security-features}. This extension point is no longer available
to third-party plugins.


*Impact* +
Some third-party plugins that were designed to work with earlier versions of
{es} might not be compatible with {es} version 8.0 or later.

If you depend on any plugins that are not produced and supported by Elastic,
check with the plugin author and ensure that the plugin is available for your
target version of {es} before upgrading.

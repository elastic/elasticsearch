.The StartRollupJob endpoint now returns a success status if a job has already started.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, attempting to start an already-started rollup job would
result in a `500 InternalServerError: Cannot start task for Rollup Job
[job] because state was [STARTED]` exception.

Now, attempting to start a job that is already started will just
return a successful `200 OK: started` response.

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to assume that a 200 status in response to
attempting to start a rollup job means the job is in an actively started state.
The request itself may have started the job, or it was previously running and so
the request had no effect.

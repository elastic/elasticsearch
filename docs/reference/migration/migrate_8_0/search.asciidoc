=== Search Changes

[float]
==== Removal of types

The `/{index}/{type}/_search`, `/{index}/{type}/_msearch`, `/{index}/{type}/_search/template` and `/{index}/{type}/_msearch/template` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_search`, `/{index}/_msearch`, `/{index}/_search/template` and `/{index}/_msearch/template`; since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete..

The `/{index}/{type}/_termvectors`, `/{index}/{type}/{id}/_termvectors` and `/{index}/{type}/_mtermvectors` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_termvectors`, `/{index}/{id}/_termvectors` and `/{index}/_mtermvectors`; since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete..

The `/{index}/{type}/{doc}` and `/{index}/{type}/_mget` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_doc/{doc}` and `/{index}/_mget`; since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete.

[float]
==== Removal of queries

The `common` query, deprecated in 7.x, has been removed in 8.0.
The same functionality can be achieved by the `match` query if the total number of hits is not tracked.

[float]
===== Removal of query parameters

The `cutoff_frequency` parameter, deprecated in 7.x, has been removed in 8.0 from `match` and `multi_match` queries.
The same functionality can be achieved without any configuration provided that the total number of hits is not tracked.

[float]
===== Removal of sort parameters

The `nested_filter` and `nested_path` options, deprecated in 6.x, have been removed in favor of the `nested` context.


[float]
===== Shard allocation awareness in Search and Get requests

{es} will no longer prefer using shards in the same location (with the same awareness attribute values) to process
`_search` and `_get` requests. Adaptive replica selection (activated by default in this version) will route requests
more efficiently using the service time of prior inter-node communications.

[float]
==== Removal of sparse vector fields
The `sparse_vector` field type was deprecated in 7.6 and is now removed in
8.0. We have not seen much interest in this experimental field type, and don't
see a clear use case as it's currently designed. If you have feedback or
suggestions around sparse vector functionality, please let us know through
GitHub or the 'discuss' forums.

[float]
==== Update to vector function signatures
The vector functions of the form `function(query, doc['field'])` were
deprecated in 7.6, and are now removed in 8.x. The form
`function(query, 'field')` should be used instead. For example,
`cosineSimilarity(query, doc['field'])` is replaced by
`cosineSimilarity(query, 'field')`.

[float]
==== Consistent rounding of range queries on `date_range` fields
`range` queries on `date_range` field currently can have slightly differently boundaries than their equivalent
query on a pure `date` field. This can e.g. happen when using date math or dates that don't specify up to the
last millisecond. While queries on `date` field round up to the latest millisecond for `gt` and `lte` boundaries,
the same queries on `date_range` fields didn't do this. The behavior is now the same for both field types like
documented in <<range-query-date-math-rounding>>.

=== Search Changes

[float]
==== Removal of types

The `/{index}/{type}/_search`, `/{index}/{type}/_msearch`, `/{index}/{type}/_search/template` and `/{index}/{type}/_msearch/template` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_search`, `/{index}/_msearch`, `/{index}/_search/template` and `/{index}/_msearch/template`, since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete..

The `/{index}/{type}/_termvectors`, `/{index}/{type}/{id}/_termvectors` and `/{index}/{type}/_mtermvectors` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_termvectors`, `/{index}/{id}/_termvectors` and `/{index}/_mtermvectors`, since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete..

[float]
==== Removal of queries

The `common` query, deprecated in 7.x, has been removed in 8.0.
The same functionality can be achieved by the `match` query if the total number of hits is not tracked.

[float]
===== Removal of query parameters

The `cutoff_frequency` parameter, deprecated in 7.x, has been removed in 8.0 from `match` and `multi_match` queries.
The same functionality can be achieved without any configuration provided that the total number of hits is not tracked.

[float]
===== Removal of sort parameters

The `nested_filter` and `nested_path` options, deprecated in 6.x, have been removed in favor of the `nested` context.


[float]
===== Shard allocation awareness in Search and Get requests

{es} will no longer prefer using shards in the same location (with the same awareness attribute values) to process
`_search` and `_get` requests. Adaptive replica selection (activated by default in this version) will route requests
more efficiently using the service time of prior inter-node communications.

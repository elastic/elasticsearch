[float]
==== The realm `order` setting is required

The `xpack.security.authc.realms.{type}.{name}.order` setting is now required and must be
specified for each explicitly configured realm. Each value must be unique.
The cluster will fail to start if the requirements are not met.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  order: 0
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
--------------------------------------------------

[[accept-default-password-removed]]
==== The `accept_default_password` setting has been removed

The `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` setting has not had any affect
since the 6.0 release of {es}. It has been removed and cannot be used.

[float]
[[roles-index-cache-removed]]
==== The `roles.index.cache.*` settings have been removed

The `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size` and
`xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl` settings have
been removed. These settings have been redundant and deprecated
since the 5.2 release of {es}.

[float]
[[migrate-tool-removed]]
==== The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool has been removed

The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool provided a way to convert file
realm users and roles into the native realm. It has been deprecated
since 7.2.0. Users and roles should now be created in the native
realm directly.

[float]
[[separating-node-and-client-traffic]]
==== The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed

The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed since
the Transport Client has been removed and therefore all client traffic now uses
the HTTP transport. Transport profiles using this setting should be removed.

[[ssl-validation-changes]]
==== SSL/TLS configuration validation

[float]
===== The `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` setting may be required

It is now an error to configure any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.transport.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled`.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.

[float]
===== The `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` setting may be required

It is now an error to configure any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.http.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as either:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.

[float]
===== The `xpack.security.transport.ssl` Certificate and Key may be required

It is now an error to enable SSL for the transport interface without also configuring
a certificate and key through use of the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings.

[float]
===== The `xpack.security.http.ssl` Certificate and Key may be required

It is now an error to enable SSL for the HTTP (Rest) server without also configuring
a certificate and key through use of the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.http.ssl.key` settings.

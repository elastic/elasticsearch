==== Security changes

//NOTE: The notable-breaking-changes tagged regions are re-used in the
//Installation and Upgrade Guide

//tag::notable-breaking-changes[]
.The realm `order` setting is now required.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.security.authc.realms.{type}.{name}.order` setting is now required and must be
specified for each explicitly configured realm. Each value must be unique.

*Impact* +
The cluster will fail to start if the requirements are not met.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  order: 0
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
--------------------------------------------------
====

[[audit-logs-are-rolled-over-and-archived-by-size]]
.Audit logs are rolled-over and archived by size.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In addition to the existing daily rollover, the security audit logs are
now rolled-over by disk size limit as well. Moreover, the rolled-over logs
are also gzip compressed.

*Impact* +
The names of rolled over audit logfiles (but not the name of the current log)
have changed.
If you've setup automated tools to consume these files, you must configure them
to use the new names and to possibly account for gzip archives instead of plaintext.
The Docker build of Elasticsearch is not affected since it logs on stdout where
rollover is not performed.
====

[[accept-default-password-removed]]
.The `accept_default_password` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` setting has not had any affect
since the 6.0 release of {es}. It has been removed and cannot be used.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password` setting.
Specifying this setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on
startup.
====

[[roles-index-cache-removed]]
.The `roles.index.cache.*` settings have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size` and
`xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl` settings have
been removed. These settings have been redundant and deprecated
since the 5.2 release of {es}.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.max_size`
and `xpack.security.authz.store.roles.index.cache.ttl` settings. Specifying
these settings in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
====

[[migrate-tool-removed]]
.The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `elasticsearch-migrate` tool provided a way to convert file
realm users and roles into the native realm. It has been deprecated
since 7.2.0. Users and roles should now be created in the native
realm directly.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `elasticsearch-migrate` tool. Attempts to use the
`elasticsearch-migrate` tool will result in an error.
====

[[separating-node-and-client-traffic]]
.The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting has been removed since
the Transport Client has been removed and therefore all client traffic now uses
the HTTP transport. Transport profiles using this setting should be removed.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `transport.profiles.*.xpack.security.type` setting.
Specifying this setting in a transport profile in `elasticsearch.yml` will
result in an error on startup.
====

[[ssl-validation-changes]]
===== SSL/TLS configuration validation

.The `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` setting is now required to configure `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It is now an error to configure any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.transport.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled`.

*Impact* +
If using other `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings, you must explicitly
specify the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` setting.

If you do not want to enable SSL and are currently using other
`xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings, do one of the following:

* Explicitly specify `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions in
{ref}/configuring-tls.html#tls-transport[Encrypting communications between nodes
in a cluster]. As part of this configuration, explicitly specify
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` as `true`.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

.The `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` setting is now required to configure `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It is now an error to configure any SSL settings for
`xpack.security.http.ssl` without also configuring
`xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`.

*Impact* +
If using other `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings, you must explicitly
specify the `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` setting.

If you do not want to enable SSL and are currently using other
`xpack.security.http.ssl` settings, do one of the following:

* Explicitly specify `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` as `false`
* Discontinue use of other `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings

If you want to enable SSL, follow the instructions in
{ref}/configuring-tls.html#tls-http[Encrypting HTTP client communications]. As part
of this configuration, explicitly specify `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled`
as `true`.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as either:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> or `false`.
====

.A `xpack.security.transport.ssl` certificate and key are now required to enable SSL for the transport interface.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It is now an error to enable SSL for the transport interface without also configuring
a certificate and key through use of the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings.

*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a
certificate and key using the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.transport.ssl.key` settings. If a certificate and key is not
provided, {es} will return in an error on startup.
====

.A `xpack.security.http.ssl` certificate and key are now required to enable SSL for the HTTP server.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It is now an error to enable SSL for the HTTP (Rest) server without also configuring
a certificate and key through use of the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path`
setting or the `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and
`xpack.security.http.ssl.key` settings.

*Impact* +
If `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is set to `true`, provide a certificate and
key using the `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path` setting or the
`xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.key`
settings. If certificate and key is not provided, {es} will return in an error
on startup.

[[ssl-misc-changes]]
==== Other SSL/TLS changes 

.PKCS#11 keystores and trustores cannot be configured in `elasticsearch.yml`
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The settings `*.ssl.keystore.type` and `*.ssl.truststore.type` no longer accept "PKCS11" as a valid type.
This applies to all SSL settings in Elasticsearch, including

- `xpack.security.http.keystore.type`
- `xpack.security.transport.keystore.type`
- `xpack.security.http.truststore.type`
- `xpack.security.transport.truststore.type`

As well as SSL settings for security realms, watcher and monitoring.

Use of a PKCS#11 keystore or truststore as the JRE's default store is not affected.

*Impact* +
If you have a PKCS#11 keystore configured within your `elasticsearch.yml` file, you must remove that
configuration and switch to a supported keystore type, or configure your PKCS#11 keystore as the 
JRE default store.

[[builtin-users-changes]]
===== Changes to built-in users

.The `kibana` user has been replaced by `kibana_system`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `kibana` user was historically used to authenticate {kib} to {es}.
The name of this user was confusing, and was often mistakenly used to login to {kib}.
This has been renamed to `kibana_system` in order to reduce confusion, and to better
align with other built-in system accounts.

*Impact* +
Replace any use of the `kibana` user with the `kibana_system` user. Specifying
the `kibana` user in `kibana.yml` will result in an error on startup.

If your `kibana.yml` used to contain:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana
--------------------------------------------------

then you should update to use the new `kibana_system` user instead:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana_system
--------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: The new `kibana_system` user does not preserve the previous `kibana`
user password. You must explicitly set a password for the `kibana_system` user.
====

[discrete]
[[builtin-roles-changes]]
===== Changes to built-in roles

.The `kibana_user` role has been renamed `kibana_admin`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Users who were previously assigned the `kibana_user` role should instead be assigned
the `kibana_admin` role. This role grants the same set of privileges as `kibana_user`, but has been
renamed to better reflect its intended use.

*Impact* +
Assign users with the `kibana_user` role to the `kibana_admin` role.
Discontinue use of the `kibana_user` role.
====
// end::notable-breaking-changes[]

// These are non-notable changes

// This change is not notable because it should not have any impact on upgrades
// However we document it here out of an abundance of caution
[[fips-default-hash-changed]]
.When FIPS mode is enabled the default password hash is now PBKDF2_STRETCH
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
If `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is true (see <<fips-140-compliance>>), 
the value of `xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm` now defaults to
`pbkdf2_stretch`.

In earlier versions this setting would always default to `bcrypt` and a runtime
check would prevent a node from starting unless the value was explicitly set to
a "pbkdf2" variant.

There is no change for clusters that do not enable FIPS 140 mode.

*Impact* +
This change should not have any impact on upgraded nodes.
Any node with an explicitly configured value for the password hashing algorithm
will continue to use that configured value.
Any node that did not have an explicitly configured password hashing algorithm in
{es} 6.x or {es} 7.x would have failed to start.

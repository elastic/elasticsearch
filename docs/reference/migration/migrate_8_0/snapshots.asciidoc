.The get snapshot API's response format has changed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It's possible to get snapshots from multiple repositories in one go. The response format has changed
and now contains separate response for each repository.

For example, requesting one snapshot from particular repository

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
GET _snapshot/repo1/snap1
-----------------------------------
// TEST[skip:no repo and snapshots are created]

produces the following response

[source,console-result]
-----------------------------------
{
  "responses": [
    {
      "repository": "repo1",
      "snapshots": [
        {
          "snapshot": "snap1",
          "uuid": "cEzdqUKxQ5G6MyrJAcYwmA",
          "version_id": 8000099,
          "version": "8.0.0",
          "indices": [],
          "include_global_state": true,
          "state": "SUCCESS",
          "start_time": "2019-05-10T17:01:57.868Z",
          "start_time_in_millis": 1557507717868,
          "end_time": "2019-05-10T17:01:57.909Z",
          "end_time_in_millis": 1557507717909,
          "duration_in_millis": 41,
          "failures": [],
          "shards": {
            "total": 0,
            "failed": 0,
            "successful": 0
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

See <<modules-snapshots>> for more information.

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to use the get snapshot API's new response
format.
====

.The `repositories.fs.compress` node-level setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

*Impact* +
Use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See
<<modules-snapshots>> for information on the `compress` setting.

Discontinue use of the `repositories.fs.compress` node-level setting.
====

.Metadata files are now compressed by default.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, the default value for `compress` was `false`. The default has been changed to `true`.

This change will affect both newly created repositories and existing repositories where `compress=false` has not been
explicitly specified.

For more information on the compress option, see <<modules-snapshots>>

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to assume a default value of `true` for
the `compress` parameter.
====

.The S3 repository plugin now uses a DNS-style access pattern by default.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Starting in version 7.4 the `repository-s3` plugin does not use the
now-deprecated path-style access pattern by default. In versions 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
and 7.3 the `repository-s3` plugin always used the path-style access pattern.
This is a breaking change for deployments that only support path-style access
but which are recognized as supporting DNS-style access by the AWS SDK. This
breaking change was made necessary by
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/[AWS's
announcement] that the path-style access pattern is deprecated and will be
unsupported on buckets created after September 30th 2020.

*Impact* +
If your deployment only supports path-style access and is affected by this
change then you must configure the S3 client setting `path_style_access` to
`true`.
====

.Restore requests no longer accept settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In earlier versions, you could pass both `settings` and `index_settings` in the
body of a restore snapshot request, but the `settings` value was ignored. The
restore snapshot API now rejects requests that include a `settings` value.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `settings` parameter in restore
snapshot request. Requests that include these parameters will return an error.

=== Get snapshots response format is changed
It's possible to get snapshots from multiple repositories in one go. The response format has changed
and now contains separate response for each repository.

For example, requesting one snapshot from particular repository

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
GET _snapshot/repo1/snap1
-----------------------------------
// TEST[skip:no repo and snapshots are created]

produces the following response

[source,console-result]
-----------------------------------
{
    "responses": [
        {
            "repository": "repo1",
            "snapshots": [
                {
                    "snapshot": "snap1",
                    "uuid": "cEzdqUKxQ5G6MyrJAcYwmA",

==== Deprecated node level compress setting removed

For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

Instead use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See <<modules-snapshots>> for information
on the `compress` setting.

[float]
==== Compression of meta data files is now on by default

Previously, the default value for `compress` was `false`. The default has been changed to `true`.

This change will affect both newly created repositories and existing repositories where `compress=false` has not been
explicitly specified.

For more information on the compress option, see <<modules-snapshots>>

[float]
==== The S3 repository plugin uses the DNS style access pattern by default

Starting in version 7.4 the `repository-s3` plugin does not use the
now-deprecated path-style access pattern by default. In versions 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
and 7.3 the `repository-s3` plugin always used the path-style access pattern.
This is a breaking change for deployments that only support path-style access
but which are recognized as supporting DNS-style access by the AWS SDK. If your
deployment only supports path-style access and is affected by this change then
you must configure the S3 client setting `path_style_access` to `true`. This
breaking change was made necessary by
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/[AWS's
announcement] that the path-style access pattern is deprecated and will be
unsupported on buckets created after September 30th 2020.

==== SQL JDBC changes

.JDBC driver returns geometry objects as well-known-text string instead of `org.elasticsearch.geo` objects.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To reduce the dependency of the JDBC driver onto Elasticsearch classes, the JDBC driver returns geometry data
as strings using the WKT (well-known text) format instead of classes from the `org.elasticsearch.geometry`.
Users can choose the geometry library desired to convert the string representation into a full-blown objects
either such as the `elasticsearch-geo` library (which returned the object `org.elasticsearch.geo` as before),
jts or spatial4j.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading, replace any `org.elasticsearch.geo` classes on the `ResultSet#getObject` or `ResultSet#setObject`
Elasticsearch JDBC driver with their WKT representation by simply calling `toString` or
`org.elasticsearch.geometry.utils.WellKnownText#toWKT/fromWKT` methods.

This change does NOT impact users that do not use geometry classes.

supported by {es}:

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS 6
* Debian 8
* openSUSE Leap 42

.Java 17 is required.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Java 17 or higher is now required to run {es} and any of its command
line tools.

*Impact* +
Use Java 17 or higher. Attempts to run {es} 8.0 using earlier Java versions will

There is not yet a FIPS-certified security module for Java 17 
that you can use when running {es} 8.0 in FIPS 140-2 mode. 
If you run in FIPS 140-2 mode, you will either need to request an exception 
from your security organization to upgrade to {es} 8.0, 
or remain on {es} 7.x until Java 17 is certified.

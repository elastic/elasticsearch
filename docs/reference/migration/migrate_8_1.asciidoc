==== Settings deprecations

[[deprecate-zen-discovery-setting]]
.Setting `discovery.type` to `zen` is deprecated.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Support for setting `discovery.type` to `zen` is deprecated and will be 
removed in a future version.

*Impact* +
If `discovery.type` is set to `zen`, {es} will change the value to `multi-node`
instead. `multi-node` replaces `zen` as the default setting, and {es} will
continue to discover other nodes when forming a cluster and allow other nodes to 
join the cluster later.

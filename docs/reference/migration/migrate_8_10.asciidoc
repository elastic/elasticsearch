[[remove_unused_executor_builder_for_vector_tile_plugin]]
.Remove the unused executor builder for vector tile plugin
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The threadpool called `vectortile` is a left over from the original development of the vector tile search end point and it is used nowhere. It can still be a breaking change if it is configured on the elasticsearch yml file, for example by changing the threadpool size `thread_pool.vectortile.size=8`'

*Impact* +
In the case the threadpool appears on the yaml file, Elasticsearch will not start until those lines are removed.

.Change pre-configured and cached analyzer components to use IndexVersion instead of Version
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
This PR changes the types used to obtain pre-configured components from Version to IndexVersion,
with corresponding changes to method names.

Prior to 8.10, there is a one-to-one mapping between node version and index version, with corresponding constants
in the IndexVersion class.
Starting in 8.10, IndexVersion is versioned independently of node version, and will be a simple incrementing number.
For more information on how to use IndexVersion and other version types, please see the contributing guide.

Analysis components now take IndexVersion instead of Version

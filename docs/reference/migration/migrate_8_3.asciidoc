[[configuring_bind_dn_in_an_ldap_or_active_directory_ad_realm_without_corresponding_bind_password_deprecated]]
.Configuring a bind DN in an LDAP or Active Directory (AD) realm without a corresponding bind password is deprecated
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
For LDAP or AD authentication realms, setting a bind DN (via the
`xpack.security.authc.realms.ldap.*.bind_dn` realm setting) without a
bind password is a misconfiguration that may prevent successful
authentication to the node. In the next major release, nodes will fail
to start if a bind DN is specified without a password.

*Impact* +
If you have a bind DN configured for an LDAP or AD authentication
realm, set a bind password for {ref}/ldap-realm.html#ldap-realm-configuration[LDAP]
or {ref}/active-directory-realm.html#ad-realm-configuration[Active Directory].
Configuring a bind DN without a password generates a warning in the
deprecation logs.

*Note:* This deprecation only applies if your current LDAP or AD
configuration specifies a bind DN without a password. This scenario is
unlikely, but might impact a small subset of users.

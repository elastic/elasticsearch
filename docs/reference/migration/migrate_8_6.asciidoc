[[deprecations_86_crud]]
==== CRUD deprecations

[[deprecate_remove_binary_default_of_false_for_ingest_attachment_processor]]
.Deprecate 'remove_binary' default of false for ingest attachment processor
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The default "remove_binary" option for the attachment processor will be changed from false to true in a later Elasticsearch release. This means that the binary file sent to Elasticsearch will not be retained.

*Impact* +
Users should update the "remove_binary" option to be explicitly true or false, instead of relying on the default value, so that no default value changes will affect Elasticsearch.

[discrete]
[[deprecations_86_cluster_and_node_setting]]
==== Cluster and node setting deprecations

[[ensure_balance_threshold_at_least_1]]
.Ensure balance threshold is at least 1
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Values for `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` smaller than `1` are now ignored. Support for values less than `1` for this setting is deprecated and will be forbidden in a future version.

*Impact* +
Set `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` to be at least `1`.
====

[discrete]
[[deprecations_86_mapping]]
==== Mapping deprecations

[[deprecate_silently_ignoring_type_fields_copy_to_boost_in_metadata_field_definition]]
.Deprecate silently ignoring type, fields, copy_to and boost in metadata field definition
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Unsupported parameters like type, fields, copy_to and boost are silently ignored when provided as part of the configuration of a metadata field in the index mappings. They will cause a deprecation warning when used in the mappings for indices that are created from 8.6 onwards.

*Impact* +
To resolve the deprecation warning, remove the mention of type, fields, copy_to or boost from any metadata field definition as part of index mappings. They take no effect so removing them won't have any impact besides resolving the deprecation warning.
====

[discrete]
[[deprecations_86_rest_api]]
==== REST API deprecations

[[state_field_deprecated_in_cluster_reroute_response]]
.state field is deprecated in /_cluster/reroute response
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
`state` field is deprecated in `/_cluster/reroute` response. Cluster state does not provide meaningful information
about the result of reroute/commands execution. There are no guarantees that this exact state would be applied.

*Impact* +
Reroute API users should not rely on `state` field and instead use `explain` to request result of commands execution.

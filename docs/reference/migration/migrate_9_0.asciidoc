[[breaking_90_analysis_changes]]
==== Analysis changes

[[snowball_stemmers_have_been_upgraded]]
.Snowball stemmers have been upgraded
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Lucene 10 ships with an upgrade of its Snowball stemmers.  For details see https://github.com/apache/lucene/issues/13209. Users using Snowball stemmers that are experiencing changes in search behaviour on  existing data are advised to reindex.

*Impact* +
The upgrade should generally provide improved stemming results. Small changes in token analysis can lead to mismatches with previously index data, so existing indices using Snowball stemmers as part of their analysis chain should be reindexed.
====

[[german2_snowball_stemmer_an_alias_for_german_stemmer]]
.The "german2" snowball stemmer is now an alias for the "german" stemmer
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Lucene 10 has merged the improved "german2" snowball language stemmer with the "german" stemmer. For Elasticsearch, "german2" is now a deprecated alias for "german". This may results in slightly different tokens being generated for terms with umlaut substitution (like "ue" for "ü" etc...)

*Impact* +
Replace usages of "german2" with "german" in analysis configuration. Old indices that use the "german" stemmer should be reindexed if possible.
====

[[persian_analyzer_has_stemmer_by_default]]
.The 'persian' analyzer has stemmer by default
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Lucene 10 has added a final stemming step to its PersianAnalyzer that Elasticsearch exposes as 'persian' analyzer. Existing indices will keep the old non-stemming behaviour while new indices will see the updated behaviour with added stemming. Users that wish to maintain the non-stemming behaviour need to define their own analyzer as outlined in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/analysis-lang-analyzer.html#persian-analyzer. Users that wish to use the new stemming behaviour for existing indices will have to reindex their data.

*Impact* +
Indexing with the 'persian' analyzer will produce slightly different tokens. Users should check if this impacts their search results. If they wish to maintain the legacy non-stemming behaviour they can define their own analyzer equivalent as explained in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.15/analysis-lang-analyzer.html#persian-analyzer.
====

[[korean_dictionary_for_nori_has_been_updated]]
.The Korean dictionary for Nori has been updated
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Lucene 10 ships with an updated Korean dictionary (mecab-ko-dic-2.1.1).  For details see https://github.com/apache/lucene/issues/11452. Users experiencing changes in search behaviour on existing data are advised to reindex.

*Impact* +
The change is small and should generally provide better analysis results. Existing indices for full-text use cases should be reindexed though.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_90_cluster_and_node_setting_changes]]
==== Cluster and node setting changes

[[minimum_shard_balancer_threshold_1_0]]
.Minimum shard balancer threshold is now 1.0
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Earlier versions of {es} accepted any non-negative value for `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold`, but values smaller than `1.0` do not make sense and have been ignored since version 8.6.1. From 9.0.0 these nonsensical values are now forbidden.

*Impact* +
Do not set `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` to a value less than `1.0`.
====

[[remove_cluster_routing_allocation_disk_watermark_enable_for_single_data_node_setting]]
.Remove `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.enable_for_single_data_node` setting
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Prior to 7.8, whenever a cluster had only a single data node, the watermarks would not be respected. In order to change this in 7.8+ in a backwards compatible way, we introduced the  `cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.enable_for_single_data_node` node setting. The setting was deprecated in 7.14 and was made to accept only true in 8.0

*Impact* +
No known end user impact
====

[[remove_deprecated_xpack_searchable_snapshot_allocate_on_rolling_restart_setting]]
.Remove deprecated `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` setting
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` setting was created as an escape-hatch just in case relying on the `cluster.routing.allocation.enable=primaries` setting for allocating searchable snapshots during rolling restarts had some unintended side-effects. It has been deprecated since 8.2.0.

*Impact* +
Remove `xpack.searchable.snapshot.allocate_on_rolling_restart` from your settings if present.
====

[[remove_unsupported_legacy_value_for_discovery_type]]
.Remove unsupported legacy value for `discovery.type`
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Earlier versions of {es} had a `discovery.type` setting which permitted values that referred to legacy discovery types. From v9.0.0 onwards, the only supported values for this setting are `multi-node` (the default) and `single-node`.

*Impact* +
Remove any value for `discovery.type` from your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_90_ingest_changes]]
==== Ingest changes

[[remove_ecs_option_on_user_agent_processor]]
.Remove `ecs` option on `user_agent` processor
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `user_agent` ingest processor no longer accepts the `ecs` option. (It was previously deprecated and ignored.)

*Impact* +
Users should stop using the `ecs` option when creating instances of the `user_agent` ingest processor. The option will be removed from existing processors stored in the cluster state on upgrade.
====

[[remove_ignored_fallback_option_on_geoip_processor]]
.Remove ignored fallback option on GeoIP processor
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The option fallback_to_default_databases on the geoip ingest processor has been removed. (It was deprecated and ignored since 8.0.0.)

*Impact* +
Customers should stop remove the noop fallback_to_default_databases option on any geoip ingest processors.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_90_mapping_changes]]
==== Mapping changes

[[remove_support_for_type_fields_copy_to_boost_in_metadata_field_definition]]
.Remove support for type, fields, copy_to and boost in metadata field definition
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The type, fields, copy_to and boost parameters are no longer supported in metadata field definition

*Impact* +
Users providing type, fields, copy_to or boost as part of metadata field definition should remove them from their mappings.
====

[discrete]
[[breaking_90_rest_api_changes]]
==== REST API changes

[[apply_more_strict_parsing_of_actions_in_bulk_api]]
.Apply more strict parsing of actions in bulk API
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, the following classes of malformed input were deprecated but not rejected in the action lines of the a bulk request: missing closing brace; additional keys after the action (which were ignored); additional data after the closing brace (which was ignored). They will now be considered errors and rejected.

*Impact* +
Users must provide well-formed input when using the bulk API. (They can request REST API compatibility with v8 to get the previous behaviour back as an interim measure.)
====

[[error_json_structure_has_changed_when_detailed_errors_are_disabled]]
.Error JSON structure has changed when detailed errors are disabled
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
This change modifies the JSON format of error messages returned to REST clients
when detailed messages are turned off.
Previously, JSON returned when an exception occurred, and `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` was set,
just consisted of a single `"error"` text field with some basic information.
Setting `http.detailed_errors.enabled: true` (the default) changed this field
to an object with more detailed information.
With this change, non-detailed errors now have the same structure as detailed errors. `"error"` will now always
be an object with, at a minimum, a `"type"` and `"reason"` field. Additional fields are included when detailed
errors are enabled.
To use the previous structure for non-detailed errors, use the v8 REST API.

*Impact* +
If you have set `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false` (the default is `true`)
the structure of JSON when any exceptions occur now matches the structure when
detailed errors are enabled.
To use the previous structure for non-detailed errors, use the v8 REST API.
====

[[remove_cluster_state_from_cluster_reroute_response]]
.Remove cluster state from `/_cluster/reroute` response
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `POST /_cluster/reroute` API no longer returns the cluster state in its response. The `?metric` query parameter to this API now has no effect and its use will be forbidden in a future version.

*Impact* +
Cease usage of the `?metric` query parameter when calling the `POST /_cluster/reroute` API.
====

[[remove_deprecated_local_attribute_from_alias_apis]]
.Remove deprecated local attribute from alias APIs
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The following APIs no longer accept the `?local` query parameter: `GET /_alias`, `GET /_aliases`, `GET /_alias/{name}`, `HEAD /_alias/{name}`, `GET /{index}/_alias`, `HEAD /{index}/_alias`, `GET /{index}/_alias/{name}`, `HEAD /{index}/_alias/{name}`, `GET /_cat/aliases`, and `GET /_cat/aliases/{alias}`. This parameter has been deprecated and ignored since version 8.12.

*Impact* +
Cease usage of the `?local` query parameter when calling the listed APIs.
====

[[remove_legacy_params_from_range_query]]
.Remove legacy params from range query
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The deprecated range query parameters `to`, `from`, `include_lower`, and `include_upper` are no longer supported.

*Impact* +
Users should use `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, and `gte` query parameters instead.
====

[[remove_support_for_deprecated_force_source_highlighting_parameter]]
.Remove support for deprecated `force_source` highlighting parameter
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The deprecated highlighting `force_source` parameter is no longer supported.

*Impact* +
Users should remove usages of the `force_source` parameter from their search requests.
====

enable <<deprecation-logging, deprecation logging>>.

[discrete]
[[deprecations_90_mapping]]
==== Mapping deprecations

[[deprecate_source_mode_in_mappings]]
.Deprecate `_source.mode` in mappings
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Configuring `_source.mode` in mappings is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use `index.mapping.source.mode` index setting instead.

*Impact* +
Use `index.mapping.source.mode` index setting instead
====

[discrete]
[[deprecations_90_rest_api]]
==== REST API deprecations

[[document_type_deprecated_on_simulate_pipeline_api]]
.Document `_type` deprecated on simulate pipeline API
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Passing a document with a `_type` property is deprecated in the `/_ingest/pipeline/{id}/_simulate` and `/_ingest/pipeline/_simulate` APIs.

*Impact* +
Users should already have stopped using mapping types, which were deprecated in {es} 7. This deprecation warning will fire if they specify mapping types on documents pass to the simulate pipeline API.
====

[[inference_api_deprecate_elser_service]]
.[Inference API] Deprecate elser service
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `elser` service of the inference API will be removed in an upcoming release. Please use the elasticsearch service instead.

*Impact* +
In the current version there is no impact. In a future version, users of the `elser` service will no longer be able to use it, and will be required to use the `elasticsearch` service to access elser through the inference API.

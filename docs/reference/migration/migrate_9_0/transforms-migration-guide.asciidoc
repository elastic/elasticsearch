== Transforms migration guide
This migration guide helps you upgrade your transforms to work with the 9.0 release. Each section will outline a breaking change along with any manual steps you need to take to upgrade your transforms to be compatible with 9.0.


=== Updating deprecated transform roles (`data_frame_transforms_admin` and `data_frame_transforms_user`)
If you have existing transforms that use deprecated transform roles (`data_frame_transforms_admin` or `data_frame_transforms_user`) you must update them to use the new equivalent transform roles (`transform_admin` or `transform_user`). To update your transform roles:
1. Switch to a user with the `transform_admin` role (to replace `data_frame_transforms_admin`) or the `transform_user` role (to replace `data_frame_transforms_user`).
2. Call the [update API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/update-transform.html) with that user.

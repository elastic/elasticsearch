== Breaking changes on the query-refactoring branch

This section discusses changes that are breaking to the current rest or java-api
on the query-refactoring feature branch.

=== Plugins

Plugins implementing custom queries need to implement the `fromXContent(QueryParseContext)` method in their
`QueryParser` subclass rather than `parse`. This method will take care of parsing the query from `XContent` format
into an intermediate query representation that can be streamed between the nodes in binary format, effectively the
query object used in the java api. Also, the query parser needs to implement the `getBuilderPrototype` method that
returns a prototype of the streamable query, which allows to deserialize an incoming query by calling
`readFrom(StreamInput)` against it, which will create a new object, see usages of `Writeable`. The `QueryParser`
also needs to declare the generic type of the query that it supports and it's able to parse.
The query object can then transform itself into a lucene query through the new `toQuery(QueryShardContext)` method,
which returns a lucene query to be executed on the data node. The query implementation also needs to implement the
`validate` method that allows to validate the content of the query, no matter whether it came in through the java api
directly or through the REST layer.

=== Java-API

==== BoostingQueryBuilder

Removed setters for mandatory positive/negative query. Both arguments now have
to be supplied at construction time already and have to be non-null.

==== SpanContainingQueryBuilder

Removed setters for mandatory big/little inner span queries. Both arguments now have
to be supplied at construction time already and have to be non-null. Updated
static factory methods in QueryBuilders accordingly.

==== SpanNearQueryBuilder

Removed setter for mandatory slop parameter, needs to be set in constructor now.
Updated the static factory methods in QueryBuilders accordingly.

==== SpanNotQueryBuilder

Removed setter for mandatory include/exclude span query clause, needs to be set in constructor now.
Updated the static factory methods in QueryBuilders and tests accordingly.

==== SpanWithinQueryBuilder

Removed setters for mandatory big/little inner span queries. Both arguments now have
to be supplied at construction time already and have to be non-null. Updated
static factory methods in QueryBuilders accordingly.

==== QueryFilterBuilder

Removed the setter `queryName(String queryName)` since this field is not supported
in this type of query. Use `FQueryFilterBuilder.queryName(String queryName)` instead 
when in need to wrap a named query as a filter.

==== WrapperQueryBuilder

Removed `wrapperQueryBuilder(byte[] source, int offset, int length)`. Instead simply
use  `wrapperQueryBuilder(byte[] source)`. Updated the static factory methods in
QueryBuilders accordingly.

==== Operator

Removed the enums called `Operator` from `MatchQueryBuilder`, `QueryStringQueryBuilder`,
`SimpleQueryStringBuilder`, and `CommonTermsQueryBuilder` in favour of using the enum
defined in `org.elasticsearch.index.query.Operator` in an effort to consolidate the
codebase and avoid duplication.

==== queryName and boost support

Support for `queryName` and `boost` has been streamlined to all of the queries. That is
a breaking change till queries get sent over the network as serialized json rather
than in `Streamable` format. In fact whenever additional fields are added to the json
representation of the query, older nodes might throw error when they find unknown fields.

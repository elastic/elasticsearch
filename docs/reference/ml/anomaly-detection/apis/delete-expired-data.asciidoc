Deletes expired and unused machine learning data.

[[ml-delete-expired-data-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`DELETE _ml/_delete_expired_data` +

`DELETE _ml/_delete_expired_data/<job_id>`

[[ml-delete-expired-data-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the 
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.

[[ml-delete-expired-data-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

Deletes all job results, model snapshots and forecast data that have exceeded
their `retention days` period. Machine learning state documents that are not
associated with any job are also deleted.

You can limit the request to a single or set of {anomaly-jobs} by using a job 
identifier, a group name, a comma-separated list of jobs, or a wildcard 
expression. You can delete expired data for all {anomaly-jobs} by using `_all`, 
by specifying `*` as the `<job_id>`, or by omitting the `<job_id>`.

[[ml-delete-expired-data-path-parms]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<job_id>`::
(Optional, string)
Identifier for an {anomaly-job}. It can be a job identifier, a group name, or a
wildcard expression.

[[ml-delete-expired-data-query-parms]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`requests_per_second`::
(Optional, float) The desired requests per second for the deletion processes.
The default behavior is no throttling.

`timeout`::
(Optional, string) How long can the underlying delete processes run until they are canceled.
The default value is `8h` (8 hours).

[[ml-delete-expired-data-request-body]]
== {api-request-body-title}

You can also specify the query parameters (`requests_per_second` and
`timeout`) in the request body.

[[ml-delete-expired-data-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

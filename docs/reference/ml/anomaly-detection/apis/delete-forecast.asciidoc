[[ml-delete-forecast-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the 
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.

[[ml-delete-forecast-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

By default, forecasts are retained for 14 days. You can specify a different
retention period with the `expires_in` parameter in the
<<ml-forecast,forecast jobs API>>. The delete forecast API enables you to delete
one or more forecasts before they expire.

NOTE: When you delete a job, its associated forecasts are deleted.

{ml-docs}/ml-ad-forecast.html[Forecasting the future].

specify this optional parameter or if you specify `_all` or `*` the API deletes all

[[ml-delete-forecast-query-parms]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`allow_no_forecasts`::
  (Optional, Boolean) Specifies whether an error occurs when there are no
  forecasts. In particular, if this parameter is set to `false` and there are no
  forecasts associated with the job, attempts to delete all forecasts return an
  error. The default value is `true`.

`timeout`::
  (Optional, <<time-units, time units>>) Specifies the period of time to wait
  for the completion of the delete operation. When this period of time elapses,
  the API fails and returns an error. The default value is `30s`.

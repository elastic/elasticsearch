= Get buckets API
++++
<titleabbrev>Get buckets</titleabbrev>
++++

Retrieves {anomaly-job} results for one or more buckets.

`GET _ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/results/buckets/<timestamp>`

[[ml-get-bucket-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}


Requires the `monitor_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the 
`machine_learning_user` built-in role.

[[ml-get-bucket-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

The get buckets API presents a chronological view of the records, grouped by
bucket.

[[ml-get-bucket-path-parms]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<job_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

`<timestamp>`::
(Optional, string) The timestamp of a single bucket result. If you do not
specify this parameter, the API returns information about all buckets.

[[ml-get-bucket-request-body]]
== {api-request-body-title}

`anomaly_score`::
(Optional, double) Returns buckets with anomaly scores greater or equal than
this value. Defaults to `0.0`.

`desc`::
(Optional, Boolean) If true, the buckets are sorted in descending order. Defaults to `false`.

`end`::
(Optional, string) Returns buckets with timestamps earlier than this time.
Defaults to `-1`, which means it is unset and results are not limited to 
specific timestamps.

`exclude_interim`::
(Optional, Boolean)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=exclude-interim-results]

`expand`::
(Optional, Boolean) If true, the output includes anomaly records. Defaults to `false`.

`page`.`from`::
(Optional, integer) Skips the specified number of buckets. Defaults to `0`.

`page`.`size`::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum number of buckets to obtain. Defaults to `100`.

`sort`::
(Optional, string) Specifies the sort field for the requested buckets. By
default, the buckets are sorted by the `timestamp` field.

`start`::
(Optional, string) Returns buckets with timestamps after this time. Defaults to 
`-1`, which means it is unset and results are not limited to specific 
timestamps.

[[ml-get-bucket-results]]
== {api-response-body-title}

The API returns an array of bucket objects, which have the following properties:

`anomaly_score`::
(number) The maximum anomaly score, between 0-100, for any of the bucket
influencers. This is an overall, rate-limited score for the job. All the anomaly 
records in the bucket contribute to this score. This value might be updated as
new data is analyzed.

`bucket_influencers`::
(array) An array of bucket influencer objects.
+
.Properties of `bucket_influencers`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`anomaly_score`:::
(number) A normalized score between 0-100, which is calculated for each bucket
influencer. This score might be updated as newer data is analyzed.

`bucket_span`:::
(number) The length of the bucket in seconds. This value matches the 
`bucket_span` that is specified in the job.

`initial_anomaly_score`:::
(number) The score between 0-100 for each bucket influencer. This score is the
initial value that was calculated at the time the bucket was processed.

`influencer_field_name`:::
(string) The field name of the influencer.

`influencer_field_value`:::
(string) The field value of the influencer. 

`is_interim`:::
(Boolean)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=is-interim]

`job_id`:::
(string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

`probability`:::
(number) The probability that the bucket has this behavior, in the range 0 to 1.
This value can be held to a high precision of over 300 decimal places, so the
`anomaly_score` is provided as a human-readable and friendly interpretation of
this.

`raw_anomaly_score`:::
(number) Internal.

`result_type`:::
(string) Internal. This value is always set to `bucket_influencer`.

`timestamp`:::
(date) The start time of the bucket for which these results were calculated.
====

`bucket_span`::
(number)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=bucket-span-results]

`event_count`::
(number) The number of input data records processed in this bucket.

`initial_anomaly_score`::
(number) The maximum `anomaly_score` for any of the bucket influencers. This is
the initial value that was calculated at the time the bucket was processed.

`is_interim`::
(Boolean)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=is-interim]

`job_id`::
(string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

`processing_time_ms`::
(number) The amount of time, in milliseconds, that it took to analyze the
bucket contents and calculate results.

`result_type`::
(string) Internal. This value is always set to `bucket`.

`timestamp`::
(date) The start time of the bucket. This timestamp uniquely identifies the
bucket. 
+
--
NOTE: Events that occur exactly at the timestamp of the bucket are included in
the results for the bucket.

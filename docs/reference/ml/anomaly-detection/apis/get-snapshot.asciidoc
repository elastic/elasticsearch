Retrieves information about model snapshots.

[[ml-get-snapshot-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

Requires the `monitor_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_user` built-in role.

`<job_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

`<snapshot_id>`::
(Optional, string)

You can get information for multiple snapshots by using a comma-separated list
or a wildcard expression. You can get all snapshots by using `_all`, by
specifying `*` as the snapshot ID, or by omitting the snapshot ID.
--

[[ml-get-snapshot-query-parms]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`desc`::
  (Optional, Boolean) If true, the results are sorted in descending order.
  Defaults to `false`.

`end`::
  (Optional, date) Returns snapshots with timestamps earlier than this time.
  Defaults to unset, which means results are not limited to specific timestamps.

`from`::
  (Optional, integer) Skips the specified number of snapshots. Defaults to `0`.

`size`::
  (Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum number of snapshots to obtain.
  Defaults to `100`.

`sort`::
  (Optional, string) Specifies the sort field for the requested snapshots. By
  default, the snapshots are sorted by their timestamp.

`start`::
  (Optional, string) Returns snapshots with timestamps after this time. Defaults
  to unset, which means results are not limited to specific timestamps.

[[ml-get-snapshot-request-body]]
== {api-request-body-title}

You can also specify the query parameters in the request body; the exception are
`from` and `size`, use `page` instead:

`from`:::
(Optional, integer) Skips the specified number of snapshots. Defaults to `0`.

`size`:::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum number of snapshots to obtain.
Defaults to `100`.

[[ml-get-snapshot-results]]
== {api-response-body-title}

The API returns an array of model snapshot objects, which have the following
properties:

`description`::
(string) An optional description of the job.

`job_id`::
(string) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the job that
  the snapshot was created for.

`latest_record_time_stamp`::
(date) The timestamp of the latest processed record.

`latest_result_time_stamp`::
(date) The timestamp of the latest bucket result.

`min_version`::
(string) The minimum {ml} configuration version number required to be
able to restore the model snapshot.

NOTE: From {es} 8.10.0,  a new version number is used to
track the configuration and state changes in the {ml} plugin. This new
version number is decoupled from the product version and will increment
independently. The `min_version` value represents the new version number.

//Begin model_size_stats
`model_size_stats`::
(object) Summary information describing the model.
+
.Properties of `model_size_stats`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`assignment_memory_basis`:::
(string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=assignment-memory-basis]

`bucket_allocation_failures_count`:::
(long) The number of buckets for which entities were not processed due to memory
limit constraints.

`categorized_doc_count`:::
(long) The number of documents that have had a field categorized.

`categorization_status`:::
(string) The status of categorization for this job.
Contains one of the following values.
+
--
* `ok`: Categorization is performing acceptably well (or not being
used at all).
* `warn`: Categorization is detecting a distribution of categories
that suggests the input data is inappropriate for categorization.
Problems could be that there is only one category, more than 90% of
categories are rare, the number of categories is greater than 50% of
the number of categorized documents, there are no frequently
matched categories, or more than 50% of categories are dead.

--

`dead_category_count`:::
(long) The number of categories created by categorization that will
never be assigned again because another category's definition
makes it a superset of the dead category.  (Dead categories are a
side effect of the way categorization has no prior training.)

`failed_category_count`:::
(long)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=failed-category-count]

`frequent_category_count`:::
(long) The number of categories that match more than 1% of categorized
documents.

`job_id`:::
(string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

`log_time`:::
(date) The timestamp that the `model_size_stats` were recorded, according to
server-time.

`memory_status`:::
(string) The status of the memory in relation to its `model_memory_limit`.
Contains one of the following values.
+
--
* `hard_limit`: The internal models require more space than the configured
memory limit. Some incoming data could not be processed.
* `ok`: The internal models stayed below the configured value.
* `soft_limit`: The internal models require more than 60% of the configured
memory limit and more aggressive pruning will be performed in order to try to
reclaim space.
--

`model_bytes`:::
(long) An approximation of the memory resources required for this analysis.

`model_bytes_exceeded`:::
(long) The number of bytes over the high limit for memory usage at the last allocation failure.

`model_bytes_memory_limit`:::
(long) The upper limit for memory usage, checked on increasing values.

`peak_model_bytes`:::
(long) The highest recorded value for the model memory usage.


`rare_category_count`:::
(long) The number of categories that match just one categorized document.

`result_type`:::
(string) Internal. This value is always `model_size_stats`.

`timestamp`:::
(date) The timestamp that the `model_size_stats` were recorded, according to the
bucket timestamp of the data.

`total_by_field_count`:::
(long) The number of _by_ field values analyzed. Note that these are counted
separately for each detector and partition.

`total_category_count`:::
(long) The number of categories created by categorization.

`total_over_field_count`:::
(long) The number of _over_ field values analyzed. Note that these are counted
separately for each detector and partition.

`total_partition_field_count`:::
(long) The number of _partition_ field values analyzed.
====
//End model_size_stats

`retain`::
(Boolean)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=retain]

`snapshot_id`::
(string) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the model
snapshot. For example: "1491852978".

`snapshot_doc_count`::
(long) For internal use only.

`timestamp`::
(date) The creation timestamp for the snapshot.

= Post data to jobs API
++++
<titleabbrev>Post data to jobs</titleabbrev>
++++

Sends data to an anomaly detection job for analysis.

[[ml-post-data-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_data`

[[ml-post-data-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have `manage_ml` or
`manage` cluster privileges to use this API. See
<<security-privileges>> and {ml-docs-setup-privileges}.

[[ml-post-data-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

The job must have a state of `open` to receive and process the data.

The data that you send to the job must use the JSON format. Multiple JSON
documents can be sent, either adjacent with no separator in between them or
whitespace separated. Newline delimited JSON (NDJSON) is a possible whitespace
separated format, and for this the `Content-Type` header should be set to
`application/x-ndjson`.

Upload sizes are limited to the Elasticsearch HTTP receive buffer size
(default 100 Mb). If your data is larger, split it into multiple chunks
and upload each one separately in sequential time order. When running in
real time, it is generally recommended that you perform many small uploads,
rather than queueing data to upload larger files.

When uploading data, check the job data counts for progress.
The following documents will not be processed:

* Documents not in chronological order and outside the latency window
* Records with an invalid timestamp

IMPORTANT:  For each job, data can only be accepted from a single connection at
a time. It is not currently possible to post data to multiple jobs using wildcards
or a comma-separated list.

[[ml-post-data-path-parms]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<job_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-anomaly-detection]

[[ml-post-data-query-parms]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`reset_start`::
		(Optional, string) Specifies the start of the bucket resetting range.

`reset_end`::
		(Optional, string) Specifies the end of the bucket resetting range.

[[ml-post-data-request-body]]
== {api-request-body-title}

A sequence of one or more JSON documents containing the data to be analyzed.
Only whitespace characters are permitted in between the documents.

[[ml-post-data-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

The following example posts data from the `it_ops_new_kpi.json` file to the
`it_ops_new_kpi` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -H "Content-type: application/json"
-X POST http:\/\/localhost:9200/_ml/anomaly_detectors/it_ops_new_kpi/_data
--data-binary @it_ops_new_kpi.json
--------------------------------------------------

When the data is sent, you receive information about the operational progress of
the job. For example:

[source,js]

	"job_id":"it_ops_new_kpi",
	"processed_record_count":21435,
	"processed_field_count":64305,

	"input_field_count":85740,
	"invalid_date_count":0,
	"missing_field_count":0,
	"out_of_order_timestamp_count":0,

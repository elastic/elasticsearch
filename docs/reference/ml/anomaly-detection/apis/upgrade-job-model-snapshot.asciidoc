++++

Upgrades an {anomaly-detect} model snapshot to the latest major version.

NOTE: From {es} 8.10.0,  a new version number is used to
track the configuration and state changes in the {ml} plugin. This new
version number is decoupled from the product version and will increment
independently.

[[ml-upgrade-job-model-snapshot-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/model_snapshots/<snapshot_id>/_upgrade`

[[ml-upgrade-job-model-snapshot-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

* Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.
* The upgraded snapshot must have a version matching the previous major version.
* The upgraded snapshot must NOT be the current {anomaly-job} snapshot.

[[ml-upgrade-job-model-snapshot-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

Over time, older snapshot formats are deprecated and removed. {anomaly-jobs-cap}
support only snapshots that are from the current or previous major version.

This API provides a means to upgrade a snapshot to the current major version.
This aids in preparing the cluster for an upgrade to the next major version.

Only one snapshot per {anomaly-job} can be upgraded at a time and the upgraded
snapshot cannot be the current snapshot of the {anomaly-job}.

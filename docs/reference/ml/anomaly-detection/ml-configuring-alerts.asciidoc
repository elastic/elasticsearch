= Generating alerts for {anomaly-jobs}

beta::[]

{kib} {alert-features} include support for {ml} rules, which run scheduled 
checks on an {anomaly-job} or a group of jobs to detect anomalies or check the 
health of the job with certain conditions. If a rule meets the conditions, an 
alert is created and the associated action is triggered. For example, you can 
create a rule to check an {anomaly-job} every fifteen minutes for critical 
anomalies and to notify you in an email. To learn more about {kib} 
{alert-features}, refer to 
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started[Alerting].

The following {ml} alerts are available:

* {anomaly-detect-cap} alert: checks if the {anomaly-job} results contain
  anomalies that match the rule conditions.
* {anomaly-jobs-cap} health: monitors job health and alerts if an operational 
  issue occured that may prevent the job from detectiong anomalies. Recommended 
  to use for jobs that already have associated {anomaly-detect} alert and you 
  want to closely monitor if these jobs work as expected.


[[creating-ml-rules]]
== Creating a rule

You can create {ml} rules in the {anomaly-job} wizard after you start the job, 
from the job list, or under **{stack-manage-app} > {alerts-ui}**.

On the *Create rule* window, give a name to the rule and optionally provide 
tags. Specify the time interval for the rule to check detected anomalies or job 
health changes. It is recommended to select an interval that is close to the 
bucket span of the job. You can also select a notification option with the 
_Notify_ selector. An alert remains active as long as the configured conditions 
are met during the check interval. When there is no matching condition in the 
next interval, the `Recovered` action group is invoked and the status of the 
alert changes to `OK`. For more details, refer to the documentation of 
{kibana-ref}/create-and-manage-rules.html#defining-rules-general-details[general rule details].

Select the rule type you want to create under the {ml} section and continue to 
configure it depending on whether it is an 
<<creating-anomaly-alert-rules, {anomaly-detect} alert>> or an 
<<creating-anomaly-jobs-health-rules, {anomaly-job} health>>.

[[creating-anomaly-alert-rules]]
=== {anomaly-detect-cap} alert

Select the {anomaly-job} or the group of {anomaly-jobs} that is checked against 
the rule. If you assign additional jobs to the group, the new jobs are 
automatically checked the next time the conditions are checked.

You can select the result type of the job that is checked against the rule. In 
particular, you can create rules based on bucket, record, or influencer results.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-anomaly-alert-severity.jpg["Selecting result type, severity, and test interval"]

For each rule, you can configure the `anomaly_score` that triggers the action. 
The `anomaly_score` indicates the significance of a given anomaly compared to 
previous anomalies. The default severity threshold is 75 which means every 
anomaly with an `anomaly_score` of 75 or higher triggers the associated action.

You can select whether you want to include interim results. Interim results are 
created by the {anomaly-job} before a bucket is finalized. These results might 
disappear after the bucket is fully processed. Include interim results if you 
want to be notified earlier about a potential anomaly even if it might be a 
false positive. If you want to get notified only about anomalies of fully 
processed buckets, do not include interim results.

You can also configure advanced settings. _Lookback interval_ sets an interval 
that is used to query previous anomalies during each condition check. Its value 
is derived from the bucket span of the job and the query delay of the {dfeed} by 
default. It is not recommended to set the lookback interval lower than the 
default value as it might result in missed anomalies. _Number of latest buckets_ 
sets how many buckets to check to obtain the highest anomaly from all the 
anomalies that are found during the _Lookback interval_. An alert is created 
based on the anomaly with the highest anomaly score from the most anomalous 
bucket.

You can also test the configured conditions against your existing data and check 
the sample results by providing a valid interval for your data. The generated 
preview contains the number of potentially created alerts during the relative 
time range you defined.

As the last step in the rule creation process, 
<<defining-actions, define the actions>> to take in case the configured criteria 
are met.


[[creating-anomaly-jobs-health-rules]]
=== {anomaly-jobs-cap} health

Select the {anomaly-job} or the group of {anomaly-jobs} that is checked against 
the rule. If you assign additional jobs to the group, the new jobs are 
automatically checked the next time the conditions are checked.

You can also use a special character (`*`) to apply the rule to all your jobs. 
Jobs created after the rule are automatically included. If you have many jobs, 
you might receive numerous notifications. To avoid this situation, you can 
exclude jobs that are not critically important by using the _Exclude_ field.

Enable the health check types that you want to apply. All checks are enabled by 
default. At least one check needs to be enabled to create the rule. The 
following health checkers are available:

* _Datafeed is not started_: notifies if the corresponding {dfeed} of the job is 
  not started but the job is in an opened state. The notification message 
  recommends you the necessary actions to solve the error.
* _Model memory limit reached_: notfies if the model memory status of the job 
  reaches the soft or hard model memory limit. Optimize your job by following 
  <<detector-configuration, these guidelines>> or consider 
  <<set-model-memory-limit, amending the model memory limit>>. 
* _Data delay has occurred_: notifies when the job missed to analyzed data. 
  You can define the threshold for the amount of missing documents you get 
  alerted on by setting _Number of documents_. You can control the lookback 
  interval for checking delayed data with _Time interval_. Refer to the 
  <<ml-delayed-data-detection>> page to see what to do about delayed data.
* _Errors in job messages_: notifies when the job messages contain error 
  messages. Review the notification; it contains the error messages, the 
  corresponding job IDs and recommendations on how to fix the issue. This check 
  looks for job errors emerged only after the rule is created.

As the last step in the rule creation process, 
<<defining-actions, define the actions>> to take in case the configured criteria 
are met.
  

[[defining-actions]]
== Defining actions

Connect your rule to actions that use supported built-in integrations by 
selecting a connector type. Connectors are {kib} services or third-party 
integrations that perform an action when the rule conditions are met.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-anomaly-alert-actions.jpg["Selecting connector type"]

For example, you can choose _Slack_ as a connector type and configure it to send 
a message to a channel you selected. You can also create an index connector that 
writes the JSON object you configure to a specific index. It's also possible to 
customize the notification messages. A list of variables is available to include 
in the message, like job ID, anomaly score, time, top influencers, {dfeed} ID, 
memory status and so on based on the selected alert type. Refer to 
<<action-variables>> to see the full list of available variables by alert type.


[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ml-anomaly-alert-messages.jpg["Customizing your message"]

After you save the configurations, the rule appears in the *{alerts-ui}* list 
where you can check its status and see the overview of its configuration 
information.

The name of an alert is always the same as the job ID of the associated 
{anomaly-job} that triggered it. You can mute the notifications for a particular 
{anomaly-job} on the page of the rule that lists the individual alerts. You can 
open it via *{alerts-ui}* by selecting the rule name.

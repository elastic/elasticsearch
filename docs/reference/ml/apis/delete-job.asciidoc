=== Delete Jobs API
++++
<titleabbrev>Delete Jobs</titleabbrev>
++++

Deletes an existing anomaly detection job.


==== Request

`DELETE _ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>`


==== Description

All job configuration, model state and results are deleted.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a job must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            job directly from the `.ml-*` indices using the Elasticsearch
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.ml-*` indices.

Before you can delete a job, you must delete the {dfeeds} that are associated
with it. See <<ml-delete-datafeed,Delete {dfeeds-cap}>>. Unless the `force` parameter
is used the job must be closed before it can be deleted.

It is not currently possible to delete multiple jobs using wildcards or a comma
separated list.

==== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

===== Query Parameters

`force`::
  (boolean) Use to forcefully delete an opened job; this method is quicker than
  closing and deleting the job.

`wait_for_completion`::
  (boolean) Specifies whether the request should return immediately or wait
  until the job deletion completes. Defaults to `true`.

==== Authorization

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see {xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].


==== Examples

The following example deletes the `total-requests` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _ml/anomaly_detectors/total-requests
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:setup:server_metrics_job]

When the job is deleted, you receive the following results:
[source,js]
----
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE

In the next example we delete the `total-requests` job asynchronously:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _ml/anomaly_detectors/total-requests?wait_for_completion=false
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:setup:server_metrics_job]

When `wait_for_completion` is set to `false`, the response contains the id
of the job deletion task:
[source,js]
----
{
  "task": "oTUltX4IQMOUUVeiohTt8A:39"
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"task": "oTUltX4IQMOUUVeiohTt8A:39"/"task": $body.task/]

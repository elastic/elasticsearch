=== {dfanalytics-cap} job resources

{dfanalytics-cap} resources relate to APIs such as <<put-dfanalytics>> and
<<get-dfanalytics>>.	

[discrete]	
[[ml-dfanalytics-properties]]	
==== {api-definitions-title}

`analysis`::
  (object) The type of analysis that is performed on the `source`. For example: 
  `outlier_detection` or `regression`. For more information, see 
  <<dfanalytics-types>>.
  
`analyzed_fields`::
  (object) You can specify both `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns. 
  If `analyzed_fields` is not set, only the relevant fields will be included. 
  For example, all the numeric fields for {oldetection}. For the supported field 
  types, see <<ml-put-dfanalytics-supported-fields>>.
  
  `includes`:::
    (array) An array of strings that defines the fields that will be 
    included in the analysis.
    
  `excludes`:::
    (array) An array of strings that defines the fields that will be 
    excluded from the analysis.

`description`::
  (Optional, string) A description of the job.

`dest`::
  (object) The destination configuration of the analysis.
  
  `index`:::
    (Required, string) Defines the _destination index_ to store the results of 
    the {dfanalytics-job}.
  
  `results_field`:::
    (Optional, string) Defines the name of the field in which to store the 
    results of the analysis. Default to `ml`.

`id`::
  (string) The unique identifier for the {dfanalytics-job}. This identifier can 
  contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and 
  underscores. It must start and end with alphanumeric characters. This property 
  is informational; you cannot change the identifier for existing jobs.
  
`model_memory_limit`::
  (string) The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are 
  permitted for analytical processing. The default value for {dfanalytics-jobs} 
  is `1gb`. If your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an 
  `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit` setting, an error occurs when you try to 
  create {dfanalytics-jobs} that have `model_memory_limit` values greater than 
  that setting. For more information, see <<ml-settings>>.

`source`::
  (object) The source configuration consisting an `index` and optionally a 
  `query` object.
  
  `index`:::
    (Required, string or array) Index or indices on which to perform the 
    analysis. It can be a single index or index pattern as well as an array of 
    indices or patterns.
    
  `query`:::
    (Optional, object) The {es} query domain-specific language 
    (<<query-dsl,DSL>>). This value corresponds to the query object in an {es} 
    search POST body. All the options that are supported by {es} can be used, 
    as this object is passed verbatim to {es}. By default, this property has 
    the following value: `{"match_all": {}}`.


[[dfanalytics-types]]
==== Analysis objects

{dfanalytics-cap} resources contain `analysis` objects. For example, when you
create a {dfanalytics-job}, you must define the type of analysis it performs.


[discrete]
[[oldetection-resources]]
==== {oldetection-cap} configuration objects 

An `outlier_detection` configuration object has the following properties:
  
`feature_influence_threshold`:: 
  (double) The minimum {olscore} that a document needs to have in order to 
  calculate its {fiscore}. Value range: 0-1 (`0.1` by default).

`method`::
  (string) Sets the method that {oldetection} uses. If the method is not set 
  {oldetection} uses an ensemble of different methods and normalises and 
  combines their individual {olscores} to obtain the overall {olscore}. We 
  recommend to use the ensemble method. Available methods are `lof`, `ldof`, 
  `distance_kth_nn`, `distance_knn`.
  
  `n_neighbors`::
  (integer) Defines the value for how many nearest neighbors each method of 
  {oldetection} will use to calculate its {olscore}. When the value is not set, 
  different values will be used for different ensemble members. This helps 
  improve diversity in the ensemble. Therefore, only override this if you are 
  confident that the value you choose is appropriate for the data set.

// TEST[skip:TBD]

<1> Training data is taken from source index `houses_sold_last_10_yrs`.
<2> Analysis results will be output to destination index 
`house_price_predictions`.
<3> The regression analysis configuration object.
<4> Regression analysis will use field `price` to train on. As no other 
parameters have been specified it will train on 100% of eligible data, store its 
prediction in destination index field `price_prediction` and use in-built 
hyperparameter optimization to give minimum validation errors.


[float]
[[regression-resources-standard]]
===== Standard parameters

`dependent_variable`::
  (Required, string) Defines which field of the document is to be predicted. 
  This parameter is supplied by field name and must match one of the fields in 
  the index being used to train. If this field is missing from a document, then 
  that document will not be used for training, but a prediction with the trained 
  model will be generated for it. The data type of the field must be numeric. It 
  is also known as continuous target variable.

`prediction_field_name`::
 (Optional, string) Defines the name of the prediction field in the results. 
 Defaults to `<dependent_variable>_prediction`.
 
`training_percent`::
 (Optional, integer) Defines what percentage of the eligible documents that will 
 be used for training. Documents that are ignored by the analysis (for example 
 those that contain arrays) won’t be included in the calculation for used 
 percentage. Defaults to `100`.


[float]
[[regression-resources-advanced]]
===== Advanced parameters

Advanced parameters are for fine-tuning {reganalysis}. They are set 
automatically by <<ml-hyperparameter-optimization,hyperparameter optimization>> 
to give minimum validation error. It is highly recommended to use the default 
values unless you fully understand the function of these parameters. If these 
parameters are not supplied, their values are automatically tuned to give 
minimum validation error.

`eta`::
 (Optional, double) The shrinkage applied to the weights. Smaller values result 
 in larger forests which have better generalization error. However, the smaller 
 the value the longer the training will take. For more information, see 
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Shrinkage[this wiki article] 
 about shrinkage.
 
`feature_bag_fraction`::
 (Optional, double) Defines the fraction of features that will be used when 
 selecting a random bag for each candidate split. 
 
`maximum_number_trees`::
 (Optional, integer) Defines the maximum number of trees the forest is allowed 
 to contain. The maximum value is 2000.

`gamma`::
 (Optional, double) Regularization parameter to prevent overfitting on the 
 training dataset. Multiplies a linear penalty associated with the size of 
 individual trees in the forest. The higher the value the more training will 
 prefer smaller trees. The smaller this parameter the larger individual trees 
 will be and the longer train will take.
 
`lambda`::
 (Optional, double) Regularization parameter to prevent overfitting on the 
 training dataset. Multiplies an L2 regularisation term which applies to leaf 
 weights of the individual trees in the forest. The higher the value the more 
 training will attempt to keep leaf weights small. This makes the prediction 
 function smoother at the expense of potentially not being able to capture 
 relevant relationships between the features and the {depvar}. The smaller this 
 parameter the larger individual trees will be and the longer train will take.


[[ml-hyperparameter-optimization]]
===== Hyperparameter optimization

If you don't supply {regression} parameters, hyperparameter optimization will be 
performed by default to set a value for the undefined parameters. The starting 
point is calculated for data dependent parameters by examining the loss on the 
training data. Subject to the size constraint, this operation provides an upper 
bound on the improvement in validation loss.

A fixed number of rounds is used for optimization which depends on the number of 
parameters being optimized. The optimitazion starts with random search, then 
Bayesian Optimisation is performed that is targeting maximum expected 
improvement. If you override any parameters, then the optimization will 
calculate the value of the remaining parameters accordingly and use the value 
you provided for the overridden parameter. The number of rounds are reduced 
respectively. The validation error is estimated in each round by using 4-fold 
cross validation.

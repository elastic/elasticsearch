=== {dfanalytics-cap} job resources

{dfanalytics-cap} resources relate to APIs such as <<put-dfanalytics>> and
<<get-dfanalytics>>.	

[discrete]	
[[ml-dfanalytics-properties]]	
==== {api-definitions-title}

`analysis`::
  (object) The type of analysis that is performed on the `source`. For example: 
  `outlier_detection`. For more information, see <<dfanalytics-types>>.
  
`analyzed_fields`::
  (object) You can specify both `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns. If 
  `analyzed_fields` is not set, only the relevant fields will be included. For 
  example all the numeric fields for {oldetection}.
  
[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ml/data_frame/analytics/loganalytics
{
  "source": {
    "index": "logdata"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "logdata_out"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "outlier_detection": {
    }
  },
  "analyzed_fields": {
        "includes": [ "request.bytes", "response.counts.error" ],
        "excludes": [ "source.geo" ]
  }

`description`::
  (Optional, string) A description of the job.

`dest`::
  (object) The destination configuration of the analysis. The `index` property 
  (string) is the name of the index in which to store the results of the 
  {dfanalytics-job}. The `results_field` (string) property defines the name of 
  the field in which to store the results of the analysis. The default value is 
  `ml`.

`id`::
  (string) The unique identifier for the {dfanalytics-job}. This identifier can 
  contain lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and 
  underscores. It must start and end with alphanumeric characters. This property 
  is informational; you cannot change the identifier for existing jobs.
  
`model_memory_limit`::
  (string) The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are 
  permitted for analytical processing. The default value for {dfanalytics-jobs} 
  is `1gb`. If your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an 
  `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit` setting, an error occurs when you try to 
  create {dfanalytics-jobs} that have `model_memory_limit` values greater than 
  that setting. For more information, see <<ml-settings>>.

`source`::
  (object) The source configuration, consisting of `index` (array) which is an 
  array of index names on which to perform the analysis. It can be a single 
  index or index pattern as well as an array of indices or patterns. Optionally, 
  `source` can have a `query` (object) property. The {es} query domain-specific 
  language (DSL). This value corresponds to the query object in an {es} search 
  POST body. All the options that are supported by {es} can be used, as this 
  object is passed verbatim to {es}. By default, this property has the following 
  value: `{"match_all": {}}`.

[[dfanalytics-types]]
==== Analysis objects

{dfanalytics-cap} resources contain `analysis` objects. For example, when you
create a {dfanalytics-job}, you must define the type of analysis it performs. 
Currently, `outlier_detection` is the only available type of analysis, however, 
other types will be added, for example `regression`.

[[oldetection-resources]]
==== {oldetection-cap} configuration objects 

An {oldetection} configuration object has the following properties:

`n_neighbors`::
  (integer) Defines the value for how many nearest neighbors each method of 
  {oldetection} will use to calculate its {olscore}. When the value is 
  not set, the system will dynamically detect an appropriate value.

`method`::
  (string) Sets the method that {oldetection} uses. If the method is not set 
  {oldetection} uses an ensemble of different methods and normalises and 
  combines their individual {olscores} to obtain the overall {olscore}. We 
  recommend to use the ensemble method. Available methods are `lof`, `ldof`, 
  `distance_kth_nn`, `distance_knn`.

`feature_influence_threshold`:: 
  (double) The minimum {olscore} that a document needs to have in order to 
  calculate its {fiscore}. 
  Value range: 0-1 (`0.1` by default).

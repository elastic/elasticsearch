[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET _ml/data_frame/analytics/_explain` +

`POST _ml/data_frame/analytics/_explain` +

`GET _ml/data_frame/analytics/<data_frame_analytics_id>/_explain` +

`POST _ml/data_frame/analytics/<data_frame_analytics_id>/_explain`


[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-prereq]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the following 
privileges:

* cluster: `monitor_ml`
  
For more information, see <<security-privileges>> and <<built-in-roles>>.


[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

This API provides explanations for a {dataframe-analytics-config} that either 
exists already or one that has not been created yet.
The following explanations are provided:

* which fields are included or not in the analysis and why,
* how much memory is estimated to be required. The estimate can be used when 
  deciding the appropriate value for `model_memory_limit` setting later on.

If you have object fields or fields that are excluded via source filtering,
they are not included in the explanation.


[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<data_frame_analytics_id>`::
(Optional, string)
include::{docdir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=job-id-data-frame-analytics]

[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

A {dataframe-analytics-config} as described in <<put-dfanalytics>>.
Note that `id` and `dest` don't need to be provided in the context of this API.

[[ml-explain-dfanalytics-results]]
==== {api-response-body-title}

The API returns a response that contains the following:

`field_selection`::
(array)
An array of objects that explain selection for each field, sorted by 
the field names.
+
.Properties of `field_selection` objects
[%collapsible%open]
====
`is_included`:::
(boolean) Whether the field is selected to be included in the analysis.

`is_required`:::
(boolean) Whether the field is required.

`feature_type`:::
(string) The feature type of this field for the analysis. May be `categorical` 
or `numerical`.

`mapping_types`:::
(string) The mapping types of the field.

`name`:::
(string) The field name.

`reason`:::
(string) The reason a field is not selected to be included in the analysis.
====

`memory_estimation`::
(object) 
An object containing the memory estimates.
+
.Properties of `memory_estimation`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`expected_memory_with_disk`:::
(string) Estimated memory usage under the assumption that overflowing to disk is 
allowed during {dfanalytics}. `expected_memory_with_disk` is usually smaller 
than `expected_memory_without_disk` as using disk allows to limit the main 
memory needed to perform {dfanalytics}.

`expected_memory_without_disk`:::
(string) Estimated memory usage under the assumption that the whole 
{dfanalytics} should happen in memory (i.e. without overflowing to disk).

[[ml-put-dfanalytics-prereq]]
== {api-prereq-title}

If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the following 
built-in roles and privileges:

* `machine_learning_admin`
* source indices: `read`, `view_index_metadata`
* destination index: `read`, `create_index`, `manage` and `index`
  
For more information, see <<built-in-roles>>, <<security-privileges>>, and
{ml-docs-setup-privileges}.


NOTE: The {dfanalytics-job} remembers which roles the user who created it had at
the time of creation. When you start the job, it performs the analysis using
those same roles. If you provide
<<http-clients-secondary-authorization,secondary authorization headers>>, 
those credentials are used instead.

[[ml-put-dfanalytics-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

This API creates a {dfanalytics-job} that performs an analysis on the source 
indices and stores the outcome in a destination index.

If the destination index does not exist, it is created automatically when you
start the job. See <<start-dfanalytics>>.

If you supply only a subset of the {regression} or {classification} parameters,
{ml-docs}/hyperparameters.html[hyperparameter optimization] occurs. It
determines a value for each of the undefined parameters.

`allow_lazy_start`::
(Optional, boolean) 
Specifies whether this job can start when there is insufficient {ml} node 
capacity for it to be immediately assigned to a node. The default is `false`; if
a {ml} node with capacity to run the job cannot immediately be found, the API
returns an error. However, this is also subject to the cluster-wide
`xpack.ml.max_lazy_ml_nodes` setting. See <<advanced-ml-settings>>. If this
option is set to `true`, the API does not return an error and the job waits in
the `starting` state until sufficient {ml} node capacity is available.

`analyzed_fields`::
(Optional, object)
Specify `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns to select which fields will be 
included in the analysis. The patterns specified in `excludes` are applied last, 
therefore `excludes` takes precedence. In other words, if the same field is 
specified in both `includes` and `excludes`, then the field will not be included 
in the analysis.
+

[[dfa-supported-fields]]
The supported fields for each type of analysis are as follows:

* {oldetection-cap} requires numeric or boolean data to analyze. The algorithms 
don't support missing values therefore fields that have data types other than 
numeric or boolean are ignored. Documents where included fields contain missing 
values, null values, or an array are also ignored. Therefore the `dest` index 
may contain documents that don't have an {olscore}.
* {regression-cap} supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`, 
`keyword`, and `ip`. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are 
supported are included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents 
where included fields contain  an array with two or more values are also 
ignored. Documents in the `dest` index  that don’t contain a results field are 
not included in the {reganalysis}.
* {classification-cap} supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`,
`keyword`, and `ip`. It is also tolerant of missing values. Fields that are 
supported are included in the analysis, other fields are ignored. Documents
where included fields contain an array with two or more values are also ignored. 
Documents in the `dest` index that don’t contain a results field are not
included in the {classanalysis}. {classanalysis-cap} can be improved by mapping
ordinal variable values to a  single number. For example, in case of age ranges,
you can model the values as "0-14" = 0, "15-24" = 1, "25-34" = 2, and so on.

If `analyzed_fields` is not set, only the relevant fields will be included. For
example, all the numeric fields for {oldetection}. For more information about
field selection, see <<explain-dfanalytics>>.

.Properties of `analyzed_fields`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`excludes`:::
(Optional, array)
An array of strings that defines the fields that will be excluded from the
analysis. You do not need to add fields with unsupported data types to
`excludes`, these fields are excluded from the analysis automatically.

`includes`:::
(Optional, array)
An array of strings that defines the fields that will be included in the 
analysis.
//End analyzed_fields

`description`::
(Optional, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=description-dfa]

`dest`::
(Required, object)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=dest]

`max_num_threads`::
(Optional, integer)
The maximum number of threads to be used by the analysis.
The default value is `1`. Using more threads may decrease the time
necessary to complete the analysis at the cost of using more CPU.
Note that the process may use additional threads for operational
functionality other than the analysis itself.
  
`model_memory_limit`::
(Optional, string)
The approximate maximum amount of memory resources that are permitted for 
analytical processing. The default value for {dfanalytics-jobs} is `1gb`. If 
your `elasticsearch.yml` file contains an `xpack.ml.max_model_memory_limit` 
setting, an error occurs when you try to create {dfanalytics-jobs} that have 
`model_memory_limit` values greater than that setting. For more information, see 
<<ml-settings>>.
  
`source`::
(object)
The configuration of how to source the analysis data. It requires an `index`.
Optionally, `query` and `_source` may be specified.
+
.Properties of `source`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`index`:::
(Required, string or array) Index or indices on which to perform the analysis.
It can be a single index or index pattern as well as an array of indices or
patterns.
+
WARNING: If your source indices contain documents with the same IDs, only the 
document that is indexed last appears in the destination index.

`query`:::
(Optional, object) The {es} query domain-specific language (<<query-dsl,DSL>>).
This value corresponds to the query object in an {es} search POST body. All the
options that are supported by {es} can be used, as this object is passed
verbatim to {es}. By default, this property has the following value:
`{"match_all": {}}`.

`_source`:::
(Optional, object) Specify `includes` and/or `excludes` patterns to select which
fields will be present in the destination. Fields that are excluded cannot be
included in the analysis.
+
.Properties of `_source`
[%collapsible%open]
=====
`includes`::::
(array) An array of strings that defines the fields that will be included in the
destination.

the destination.

[[ml-put-dfanalytics-example-preprocess]]
=== Preprocessing actions example

The following example shows how to limit the scope of the analysis to certain 
fields, specify excluded fields in the destination index, and use a query to 
filter your data before analysis.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _ml/data_frame/analytics/model-flight-delays-pre
{
  "source": {
    "index": [
      "kibana_sample_data_flights" <1>
    ],
    "query": { <2>
      "range": {
        "DistanceKilometers": { 
          "gt": 0
        }
      }
    },
    "_source": { <3>
      "includes": [],
      "excludes": [
        "FlightDelay",
        "FlightDelayType"
      ]
    }
  },
  "dest": { <4>
    "index": "df-flight-delays",
    "results_field": "ml-results"
  },
  "analysis": {
  "regression": {
    "dependent_variable": "FlightDelayMin",
    "training_percent": 90
    }
  },
  "analyzed_fields": { <5>
    "includes": [],
    "excludes": [   
      "FlightNum"
    ]
  },
  "model_memory_limit": "100mb"
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:setup kibana sample data]

<1> Source index to analyze.
<2> This query filters out entire documents that will not be present in the 
destination index.
<3> The `_source` object defines fields in the dataset that will be included or 
excluded in the destination index. 
<4> Defines the destination index that contains the results of the analysis and 
the fields of the source index specified in the `_source` object. Also defines 
the name of the `results_field`.
<5> Specifies fields to be included in or excluded from the analysis. This does 
not affect whether the fields will be present in the destination index, only 
affects whether they are used in the analysis.

In this example, we can see that all the fields of the source index are included 
in the destination index except `FlightDelay` and `FlightDelayType` because 
these are defined as excluded fields by the `excludes` parameter of the 
`_source` object. The `FlightNum` field is included in the destination index, 
however it is not included in the analysis because it is explicitly specified as 
excluded field by the `excludes` parameter of the `analyzed_fields` object.

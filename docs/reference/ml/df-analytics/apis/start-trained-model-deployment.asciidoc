[[start-trained-model-deployment-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/trained_models/<model_id>/deployent/_start`

[[start-trained-model-deployment-prereq]]
== {api-prereq-title}
Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-desc]]
== {api-description-title}
This starts a new model deployment. Currently only `pytorch` models are supported
for deployment. When deployed, the model attempts allocation to every machine learning
node.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-path-params]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<model_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=model-id]

[[start-trained-model-deployment-query-params]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`timeout`::
(Optional, time)
Controls the amount of time to wait for the model to deploy. Defaults
to 20 seconds.

`wait_for`::
(Optional, string)
Which allocation status to wait for before returning. Defaults to "started".
Valid values are: "starting", "started", and "fully_allocated". Each
indicating, respectively, deployment is starting but not yet on any
node, the model has started on at least one node, the deployment has
started on all valid nodes.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

Here is an example for starting a new model deployment for an existing model.

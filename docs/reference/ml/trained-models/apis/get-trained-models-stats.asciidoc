[[ml-get-trained-models-stats-prereq]]

Requires the `monitor_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_user` built-in role.


[[ml-get-trained-models-stats-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

You can get usage information for multiple trained models or trained model 
deployments in a single API request by using a comma-separated list of model 
IDs, deployment IDs, or a wildcard expression.

deployments, and the ID of one of the deployments matches the model ID, then the 
model ID takes precedence; the results are returned for all deployments of the 
model.

(long)
The epoch timestamp when the allocation started.

`threads_per_allocation`:::

The number of threads for each allocation during inference.
This value is limited by the number of hardware threads on the node;
it might therefore differ from the `threads_per_allocation` value in the <<start-trained-model-deployment>> API.

`timeout_count`:::

The number of inference requests that timed out before being processed.

`throughput_last_minute`:::
(integer)

<<start-trained-model-deployment>> API.

`reason`:::

The total number of times the model has been called for inference.
This is across all inference contexts, including all pipelines.

`cache_miss_count`:::
(integer)
The number of times the model was loaded for inference and was not retrieved
from the cache. If this number is close to the `inference_count`, then the cache
is not being appropriately used. This can be solved by increasing the cache size
or its time-to-live (TTL). See <<general-ml-settings>> for the appropriate
settings.

`failure_count`:::
(integer)
The number of failures when using the model for inference.

`timestamp`:::
(<<time-units,time units>>)

  resources that match the request or only partial matches for the request.

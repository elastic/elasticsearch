[[ml-put-trained-model-definition-part-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`PUT _ml/trained_models/<model_id>/definition/<part_num>`


[[ml-put-trained-model-definition-part-prereq]]
== {api-prereq-title}

Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.


[[ml-put-trained-model-definition-part-path-params]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<model_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=model-id]

`<part>`::
(Required, number)
The definition part number. When the definition is loaded for inference
the definition parts will be streamed in order of their `part_num`.
The first part must be `0` and the final part must be `total_parts - 1`.

[[ml-put-trained-model-definition-part-request-body]]
== {api-request-body-title}

`definition`::
(Required, string)
The definition part for the model. Must be a base64 encoded string.

`total_definition_length`::
(Required, number)
The total uncompressed definition length in bytes. Not base64 encoded.

`total_parts`::
(Required, number)
The total number of parts that will be uploaded. Must be greater than 0.

[[ml-put-trained-model-definition-part-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

The following example creates a model definition part for a previously
stored model configuration. The definition part is stored in the index
that is configured by the `location.index.name`.


NOTE: The value of the `definition` object is elided from the example
as it is a very large base64 encoded string.

=== Shard Allocation Awareness

When running nodes on multiple VMs on the same physical server, on multiple
racks, or across multiple awareness zones, it is more likely that two nodes on
the same physical server, in the same rack, or in the same awareness zone will
crash at the same time, rather than two unrelated nodes crashing
simultaneously.

If Elasticsearch is _aware_ of the physical configuration of your hardware, it
can ensure that the primary shard and its replica shards are spread across
different physical servers, racks, or zones, to minimise the risk of losing
all shard copies at the same time.

The shard allocation awareness settings allow you to tell Elasticsearch about
your hardware configuration.

As an example, let's assume we have several racks.  When we start a node, we
can tell it which rack it is in by assigning it an arbitrary metadata
attribute called `rack_id` -- we could use any attribute name.  For example:

[source,sh]
----------------------
./bin/elasticsearch -Enode.attr.rack_id=rack_one <1>
----------------------
<1> This setting could also be specified in the `elasticsearch.yml` config file.

Now, we need to setup _shard allocation awareness_  by telling Elasticsearch
which attributes to use.  This can be configured in the `elasticsearch.yml`
file on *all* master-eligible nodes, or it can be set (and changed) with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.

For our example, we'll set the value in the config file:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------
cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes: rack_id
--------------------------------------------------------

With this config in place, let's say we start two nodes with `node.attr.rack_id`
set to `rack_one`, and we create an index with 5 primary shards and 1 replica
of each primary.  All primaries and replicas are allocated across the two
nodes.

Now, if we start two more nodes with `node.attr.rack_id` set to `rack_two`,
Elasticsearch will move shards across to the new nodes, ensuring (if possible)
that no two copies of the same shard will be in the same rack. However if `rack_two`
were to fail, taking down both of its nodes, Elasticsearch will still allocate the lost
shard copies to nodes in `rack_one`. 

.Prefer local shards
*********************************************

When executing search or GET requests, with shard awareness enabled,
Elasticsearch will prefer using local shards -- shards in the same awareness
group -- to execute the request. This is usually faster than crossing racks or
awareness zones.

*********************************************

Multiple awareness attributes can be specified, in which case the combination
of values from each attribute is considered to be a separate value.

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------
cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes: rack_id,zone
-------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: When using awareness attributes, shards will not be allocated to
nodes that don't have values set for those attributes.

NOTE: Number of primary/replica of a shard allocated on a specific group
of nodes with the same awareness attribute value is determined by the number
of attribute values. When the number of nodes in groups is unbalanced and
there are many replicas, replica shards may be left unassigned.

=== Forced Awareness

Imagine that you have two awareness zones and enough hardware across the two
zones to host all of your primary and replica shards.  But perhaps the
hardware in a single zone, while sufficient to host half the shards, would be
unable to host *ALL* the shards.

With ordinary awareness, if one zone lost contact with the other zone,
Elasticsearch would assign all of the missing replica shards to a single zone.
But in this example, this sudden extra load would cause the hardware in the
remaining zone to be overloaded.

Forced awareness solves this problem by *NEVER* allowing copies of the same
shard to be allocated to the same zone.

For example, lets say we have an awareness attribute called `zone`, and
we know we are going to have two zones, `zone1` and `zone2`. Here is how
we can force awareness on a node:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.zone.values: zone1,zone2 <1>
cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes: zone
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> We must list all possible values that the `zone` attribute can have.

Now, if we start 2 nodes with `node.attr.zone` set to `zone1` and create an index
with 5 shards and 1 replica. The index will be created, but only the 5 primary
shards will be allocated (with no replicas). Only when we start more nodes
with `node.attr.zone` set to `zone2` will the replicas be allocated.

The `cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.*` settings can all be updated
dynamically on a live cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.

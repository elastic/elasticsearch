==== Cluster-level shard allocation filtering

You can use cluster-level shard allocation filters to control where {es}
allocates shards from any index. These cluster wide filters are applied in
conjunction with <<shard-allocation-filtering, per-index allocation filtering>>
and <<shard-allocation-awareness, allocation awareness>>.

Shard allocation filters can be based on custom node attributes or the built-in
`_name`, `_host_ip`, `_publish_ip`, `_ip`, `_host`, `_id` and `_tier` attributes.

The `cluster.routing.allocation` settings are <<dynamic-cluster-setting,dynamic>>, enabling live indices to
be moved from one set of nodes to another. Shards are only relocated if it is
possible to do so without breaking another routing constraint, such as never
allocating a primary and replica shard on the same node.

The most common use case for cluster-level shard allocation filtering is when
you want to decommission a node. To move shards off of a node prior to shutting
it down, you could create a filter that excludes the node by its IP address:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._ip" : "10.0.0.1"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

[[cluster-routing-settings]]
===== Cluster routing settings

`cluster.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Allocate shards to a node whose `{attribute}` has at least one of the
    comma-separated values.

`cluster.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Only allocate shards to a node whose `{attribute}` has _all_ of the
    comma-separated values.

`cluster.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Do not allocate shards to a node whose `{attribute}` has _any_ of the
    comma-separated values.

The cluster allocation settings support the following built-in attributes:

[horizontal]
`_name`::       Match nodes by node name
`_host_ip`::    Match nodes by host IP address (IP associated with hostname)
`_publish_ip`:: Match nodes by publish IP address
`_ip`::         Match either `_host_ip` or `_publish_ip`
`_host`::       Match nodes by hostname
`_id`::         Match nodes by node id
`_tier`::       Match nodes by the node's <<data-tiers, data tier>> role

NOTE: `_tier` filtering is based on <<modules-node, node>> roles. Only
a subset of roles are <<data-tiers, data tier>> roles, and the generic
<<data-node, data role>> will match any tier filtering.
a subset of roles that are <<data-tiers, data tier>> roles, but the generic
<<data-node, data role>> will match any tier filtering.


You can use wildcards when specifying attribute values, for example:

[source,console]
------------------------
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._ip": "192.168.2.*"
  }
}
------------------------

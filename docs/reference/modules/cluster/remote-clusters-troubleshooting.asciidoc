You may encounter several issues when setting up a remote cluster for {ccr} or
{ccs}.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-general]]
==== General troubleshooting

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-check-connection]]
===== Checking whether a remote cluster has connected successfully

A successful call to the cluster settings update API for adding or updating
remote clusters does not necessarily mean the configuration is successful.
Use the <<cluster-remote-info,remote cluster info API>> to verify that a local
cluster is successfully connected to a remote cluster.

include::remote-clusters-remote-info.asciidoc[]

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-enable-server]]
===== Enabling the remote cluster server

When using API key authentication, cross-cluster traffic happens on the remote
cluster interface, instead of the transport interface. The remote cluster
interface is not enabled by default. This means a node is not ready to accept
incoming cross-cluster requests by default, while it is ready to send outgoing
cross-cluster requests. Ensure you've enabled the remote cluster server on every
node of the remote cluster. In `elasticsearch.yml`:

* Set <<remote-cluster-network-settings,`remote_cluster_server.enabled`>> to 
`true`.
* Configure the bind and publish address for remote cluster server traffic, for
example using <<remote-cluster-network-settings,`remote_cluster.host`>>. Without
configuring the address, remote cluster traffic may be bound to the local
interface, and remote clusters running on other machines can't connect.
* Optionally, configure the remote server port using 
<<remote_cluster.port,`remote_cluster.port`>> (defaults to `9443`).

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-common-issues]]
==== Common issues

The following issues are listed in the order they may occur while setting up a
remote cluster.

[[remote-clusters-not-reachable]]
===== Remote cluster not reachable

====== Symptom

A local cluster may not be able to reach a remote cluster for many reasons. For
example, the remote cluster server may not be enabled, an incorrect host or port
may be configured, or a firewall may be blocking traffic. When a remote cluster
is not reachable, check the logs of the local cluster for a `connect_exception`.

When the remote cluster is configured using proxy mode:
[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T16:36:47,264][WARN ][o.e.t.ProxyConnectionStrategy] [local-node] failed to open any proxy connections to cluster [my]
org.elasticsearch.transport.ConnectTransportException: [][192.168.0.42:9443] *connect_exception*
----

When the remote cluster is configured using sniff mode:
[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T16:38:37,731][WARN ][o.e.t.SniffConnectionStrategy] [local-node] fetching nodes from external cluster [my] failed
org.elasticsearch.transport.ConnectTransportException: [][192.168.0.42:9443] *connect_exception*
----

====== Resolution

* Check the host and port for the remote cluster are correct.
* Ensure the <<remote-clusters-troubleshooting-enable-server,remote cluster 
server is enabled>> on the remote cluster.
* Ensure no firewall is blocking the communication.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-tls-trust]]
===== TLS trust not established

TLS can be misconfigured on the local or the remote cluster. The result is that
the local cluster does not trust the certificate presented by the remote
cluster.

====== Symptom

The local cluster logs `failed to establish trust with server`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-29T09:40:55,465][WARN ][o.e.c.s.DiagnosticTrustManager] [local-node] *failed to establish trust with server* at [192.168.0.42]; the server provided a certificate with subject name [CN=remote_cluster], fingerprint [529de35e15666ffaa26afa50876a2a48119db03a], no keyUsage and no extendedKeyUsage; the certificate is valid between [2023-01-29T12:08:37Z] and [2032-08-29T12:08:37Z] (current time is [2023-08-16T23:40:55.464275Z], certificate dates are valid); the session uses cipher suite [TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384] and protocol [TLSv1.3]; the certificate has subject alternative names [DNS:localhost,DNS:localhost6.localdomain6,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1,DNS:localhost4,DNS:localhost6,DNS:localhost.localdomain,DNS:localhost4.localdomain4,IP:192.168.0.42]; the certificate is issued by [CN=Elastic Auto RemoteCluster CA] but the server did not provide a copy of the issuing certificate in the certificate chain; this ssl context ([(shared) (with trust configuration: JDK-trusted-certs)]) is not configured to trust that issuer but trusts [97] other issuers
sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
----

The remote cluster logs `client did not trust this server's certificate`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-29T09:40:55,478][WARN ][o.e.x.c.s.t.n.SecurityNetty4Transport] [remote-node] *client did not trust this server's certificate*, closing connection Netty4TcpChannel{localAddress=/192.168.0.42:9443, remoteAddress=/192.168.0.84:57305, profile=_remote_cluster}
----

====== Resolution

Read the warn log message on the local cluster carefully to determine the exact
cause of the failure. For example:

* Is the remote cluster certificate not signed by a trusted CA? This is the most
likely cause.
* Is hostname verification failing? 
* Is the certificate expired?

Once you know the cause, you should be able to fix it by adjusting the remote
cluster related SSL settings on either the local cluster or the remote cluster. 

Often, the issue is on the local cluster. For example, fix it by configuring necessary
trusted CAs (`xpack.security.remote_cluster_client.ssl.certificate_authorities`).

If you change the `elasticsearch.yml` file, the associated cluster needs to be
restarted for the changes to take effect.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-api-key]]
==== API key authentication issues

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-transport-port-api-key]]
===== Connecting to transport port when using API key authentication

When using API key authentication, a local cluster should connect to a remote
cluster's remote cluster server port (defaults to `9443`) instead of the
transport port (defaults to `9300`). A misconfiguration can lead to a number of
symptoms:

====== Symptom 1

It's recommended to use different CAs and certificates for the transport
interface and the remote cluster server interface. If this recommendation is
followed, a remote cluster client node does not trust the server certificate
presented by a remote cluster on the transport interface.

The local cluster logs `failed to establish trust with server`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T12:48:46,575][WARN ][o.e.c.s.DiagnosticTrustManager] [local-node] *failed to establish trust with server* at [1192.168.0.42]; the server provided a certificate with subject name [CN=transport], fingerprint [c43e628be2a8aaaa4092b82d78f2bc206c492322], no keyUsage and no extendedKeyUsage; the certificate is valid between [2023-01-29T12:05:53Z] and [2032-08-29T12:05:53Z] (current time is [2023-06-28T02:48:46.574738Z], certificate dates are valid); the session uses cipher suite [TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384] and protocol [TLSv1.3]; the certificate has subject alternative names [DNS:localhost,DNS:localhost6.localdomain6,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1,DNS:localhost4,DNS:localhost6,DNS:localhost.localdomain,DNS:localhost4.localdomain4,IP:192.168.0.42]; the certificate is issued by [CN=Elastic Auto Transport CA] but the server did not provide a copy of the issuing certificate in the certificate chain; this ssl context ([xpack.security.remote_cluster_client.ssl (with trust configuration: PEM-trust{/rcs2/ssl/remote-cluster-ca.crt})]) is not configured to trust that issuer, it only trusts the issuer [CN=Elastic Auto RemoteCluster CA] with fingerprint [ba2350661f66e46c746c1629f0c4b645a2587ff4]
sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
----

The remote cluster logs `client did not trust this server's certificate`:
[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T12:48:46,584][WARN ][o.e.x.c.s.t.n.SecurityNetty4Transport] [remote-node] *client did not trust this server's certificate*, closing connection Netty4TcpChannel{localAddress=/192.168.0.42:9309, remoteAddress=/192.168.0.84:60810, profile=default}
----

====== Symptom 2

The CA and certificate can be shared between the transport and remote cluster
server interface. Since a remote cluster client does not have a client
certificate by default, the server will fail to verify the client certificate.

The local cluster logs `Received fatal alert: bad_certificate`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T12:43:30,705][WARN ][o.e.t.TcpTransport       ] [local-node] exception caught on transport layer [Netty4TcpChannel{localAddress=/192.168.0.84:60738, remoteAddress=/192.168.0.42:9309, profile=_remote_cluster}], closing connection
io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: *Received fatal alert: bad_certificate*
----

The remote cluster logs `Empty client certificate chain`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----

io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: *Empty client certificate chain*
----

====== Symptom 3

If the remote cluster client is configured for mTLS and provides a valid client
certificate, the connection fails because the client does not send the expected
authentication header.

The local cluster logs `missing authentication`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T13:04:52,710][WARN ][o.e.t.ProxyConnectionStrategy] [local-node] failed to open any proxy connections to cluster [my]

Caused by: org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSecurityException: *missing authentication* credentials for action [cluster:internal/remote_cluster/handshake]
----

This does not show up in the logs of the remote cluster.

====== Symptom 4

If anonymous access is enabled on the remote cluster and it does not require
authentication, depending on the privileges of the anonymous user, the local
cluster may log the following.

If the anonymous user does not the have necessary privileges to make a
connection, the local cluster logs `unauthorized`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
org.elasticsearch.transport.RemoteTransportException: [remote-node][192.168.0.42:9309][cluster:internal/remote_cluster/handshake]
Caused by: org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSecurityException: action [cluster:internal/remote_cluster/handshake] is *unauthorized* for user [anonymous_foo] with effective roles [reporting_user], this action is granted by the cluster privileges [cross_cluster_search,cross_cluster_replication,manage,all]
----

If the anonymous user has necessary privileges, for example it is a superuser,
the local cluster logs `requires channel profile to be [_remote_cluster],
but got [default]`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T13:09:52,031][WARN ][o.e.t.ProxyConnectionStrategy] [local-node] failed to open any proxy connections to cluster [my]
org.elasticsearch.transport.RemoteTransportException: [remote-node][192.168.0.42:9309][cluster:internal/remote_cluster/handshake]
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: remote cluster handshake action *requires channel profile to be [_remote_cluster], but got [default]*
----

====== Resolution

Check the port number and ensure you are indeed connecting to the remote cluster
server instead of the transport interface.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-no-api-key]]
===== Connecting without a cross-cluster API key

A local cluster uses the presence of a cross-cluster API key to determine the
model with which it connects to a remote cluster. If a cross-cluster API key is
present, it uses API key based authentication. Otherwise, it uses certificate
based authentication. You can check what model is being used with the <<cluster-remote-info,remote cluster info API>> on the local cluster:

include::remote-clusters-remote-info.asciidoc[]

Besides checking the response of the remote cluster info API, you can also check
the logs.

====== Symptom 1

If no cross-cluster API key is used, the local cluster uses the certificate
based authentication method, and connects to the remote cluster using the TLS
configuration of the transport interface. If the remote cluster has different
TLS CA and certificate for transport and remote cluster server interfaces (which
is the recommendation), TLS verification will fail.

The local cluster logs `failed to establish trust with server`:

----

====== Symptom 2

Even if TLS verification is not an issue, the connection fails due to missing
credentials.

The local cluster logs `Please ensure you have configured remote cluster credentials`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cross cluster requests through the dedicated remote cluster server port require transport header [_cross_cluster_access_credentials] but none found. *Please ensure you have configured remote cluster credentials* on the cluster originating the request.
----

This does not show up in the logs of the remote cluster.

====== Resolution

Add the cross-cluster API key to {es} keystore on every node of the local
cluster. Restart the local cluster to reload the keystore.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-wrong-api-key-type]]
===== Using the wrong API key type

API key based authentication requires
<<security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key,cross-cluster API keys>>. It does
not work with <<security-api-create-api-key,REST API keys>>.

====== Symptom

The local cluster logs `authentication expected API key type of [cross_cluster]`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T13:26:53,962][WARN ][o.e.t.ProxyConnectionStrategy] [local-node] failed to open any proxy connections to cluster [my]

Caused by: org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSecurityException: *authentication expected API key type of [cross_cluster]*, but API key [agZXJocBmA2beJfq2yKu] has type [rest]
----

This does not show up in the logs of the remote cluster.

====== Resolution

Ask the remote cluster administrator to create and distribute a
<<security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key,cross-cluster API key>>. Replace the
existing API key in the {es} keystore with this cross-cluster API key on every
node of the local cluster. Restart the local cluster for keystore changes to
take effect.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-non-valid-api-key]]
===== Invalid API key

A cross-cluster API can fail to authenticate. For example, when its credentials
are incorrect, or if it's invalidated or expired.

====== Symptom

The local cluster logs `unable to authenticate`:

[source,txt,subs=+quotes]
----
[2023-06-28T13:22:58,264][WARN ][o.e.t.ProxyConnectionStrategy] [local-node] failed to open any proxy connections to cluster [my]

====== Resolution

Ask the remote cluster administrator to create and distribute a
<<security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key,cross-cluster API key>>. Replace the
existing API key in the {es} keystore with this cross-cluster API key on every
node of the local cluster. Restart the local cluster for keystore changes to
take effect.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-insufficient-privileges]]
===== API key or local user has insufficient privileges

The effective permission for a local user running requests on a remote cluster
is determined by the intersection of the cross-cluster API key's privileges and
the local user's `remote_indices` privileges. 

====== Symptom

Request failures due to insufficient privileges result in API responses like:

[source,js,subs=+quotes]
----
{
    "type": "security_exception",
    "reason": "action [indices:data/read/search] towards remote cluster is *unauthorized for user* [foo] with assigned roles [foo-role] authenticated by API key id [agZXJocBmA2beJfq2yKu] of user [elastic-admin] on indices [cd], this action is granted by the index privileges [read,all]"
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

This does not show up in any logs.

====== Resolution

. Check that the local user has the necessary `remote_indices` privileges. Grant sufficient `remote_indices` privileges if necessary.
. If permission is not an issue locally, ask the remote cluster administrator to
create and distribute a
<<security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key,cross-cluster API key>>. Replace the
existing API key in the {es} keystore with this cross-cluster API key on every
node of the local cluster. Restart the local cluster for keystore changes to
take effect.

[[remote-clusters-troubleshooting-no-remote_indices-privileges]]
===== Local user has no `remote_indices` privileges

This is a special case of insufficient privileges. In this case, the local user
has no `remote_indices` privileges at all for the target remote cluster. {es}
can detect that and issue a more explicit error response.

====== Symptom

This results in API responses like:

[source,js,subs=+quotes]
----
{
    "type": "security_exception",
    "reason": "action [indices:data/read/search] towards remote cluster [my] is unauthorized for user [foo] with effective roles [] (assigned roles [foo-role] were not found) because *no remote indices privileges apply for the target cluster*"
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

====== Resolution

Grant sufficient `remote_indices` privileges to the local user.

[[cluster-shard-allocation-settings]]
==== Cluster-level shard allocation settings

You can use the following settings to control shard allocation and recovery:

[[cluster-routing-allocation-enable]]
`cluster.routing.allocation.enable`::
+
--
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Enable or disable allocation for specific kinds of shards:

* `all` -             (default) Allows shard allocation for all kinds of shards.
* `primaries` -       Allows shard allocation only for primary shards.
* `new_primaries` -   Allows shard allocation only for primary shards for new indices.
* `none` -            No shard allocations of any kind are allowed for any indices.

This setting does not affect the recovery of local primary shards when
restarting a node. A restarted node that has a copy of an unassigned primary
shard will recover that primary immediately, assuming that its allocation id matches
one of the active allocation ids in the cluster state.

--

`cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_incoming_recoveries`::
     (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
     How many concurrent incoming shard recoveries are allowed to happen on a node. Incoming recoveries are the recoveries
     where the target shard (most likely the replica unless a shard is relocating) is allocated on the node. Defaults to `2`.

`cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_outgoing_recoveries`::
     (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
     How many concurrent outgoing shard recoveries are allowed to happen on a node. Outgoing recoveries are the recoveries
     where the source shard (most likely the primary unless a shard is relocating) is allocated on the node. Defaults to `2`.

`cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries`::
     (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
     A shortcut to set both `cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_incoming_recoveries` and
     `cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_outgoing_recoveries`. Defaults to 2.


`cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    While the recovery of replicas happens over the network, the recovery of
    an unassigned primary after node restart uses data from the local disk.
    These should be fast so more initial primary recoveries can happen in
    parallel on the same node. Defaults to `4`.

[[cluster-routing-allocation-same-shard-host]]
`cluster.routing.allocation.same_shard.host`::
      (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
      If `true`, forbids multiple copies of a shard from being allocated to
      distinct nodes on the same host, i.e. which have the same network
      address. Defaults to `false`, meaning that copies of a shard may
      sometimes be allocated to nodes on the same host. This setting is only
      relevant if you run multiple nodes on each host.

[[shards-rebalancing-settings]]
==== Shard rebalancing settings

A cluster is _balanced_ when it has an equal number of shards on each node, with
all nodes needing equal resources, without having a concentration of shards from
any index on any node. {es} runs an automatic process called _rebalancing_ which
moves shards between the nodes in your cluster to improve its balance.
Rebalancing obeys all other shard allocation rules such as
<<cluster-shard-allocation-filtering,allocation filtering>> and
<<forced-awareness,forced awareness>> which may prevent it from completely
balancing the cluster. In that case, rebalancing strives to achieve the most
balanced cluster possible within the rules you have configured. If you are using
<<data-tiers,data tiers>> then {es} automatically applies allocation filtering
rules to place each shard within the appropriate tier. These rules mean that the
balancer works independently within each tier.

You can use the following settings to control the rebalancing of shards across
the cluster:

`cluster.routing.rebalance.enable`::
+
--
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Enable or disable rebalancing for specific kinds of shards:

* `all` -         (default) Allows shard balancing for all kinds of shards.
* `primaries` -   Allows shard balancing only for primary shards.
* `replicas` -    Allows shard balancing only for replica shards.
* `none` -        No shard balancing of any kind are allowed for any indices.
--

`cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance`::
+
--
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Specify when shard rebalancing is allowed:


* `always` -                    Always allow rebalancing.
* `indices_primaries_active` -  Only when all primaries in the cluster are allocated.
* `indices_all_active` -        (default) Only when all shards (primaries and replicas) in the cluster are allocated.
--

`cluster.routing.allocation.cluster_concurrent_rebalance`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Defines the number of concurrent shard rebalances are allowed across the whole
cluster. Defaults to `2`. Note that this setting only controls the number of
concurrent shard relocations due to imbalances in the cluster. This setting does
not limit shard relocations due to
<<cluster-shard-allocation-filtering,allocation filtering>> or
<<forced-awareness,forced awareness>>.

`cluster.routing.allocation.type`::
+
--
Selects the algorithm used for computing the cluster balance. Defaults to
`desired_balance` which selects the _desired balance allocator_. This allocator
runs a background task which computes the desired balance of shards in the
cluster. Once this background task completes, {es} moves shards to their
desired locations.

May also be set to `balanced` to select the legacy _balanced allocator_. This
allocator was the default allocator in versions of {es} before 8.6.0. It runs
in the foreground, preventing the master from doing other work in parallel. It
works by selecting a small number of shard movements which immediately improve
the balance of the cluster, and when those shard movements complete it runs
again and selects another few shards to move. Since this allocator makes its
decisions based only on the current state of the cluster, it will sometimes
move a shard several times while balancing the cluster.

[[shards-rebalancing-heuristics]]
==== Shard balancing heuristics settings

Rebalancing works by computing a _weight_ for each node based on its allocation
of shards, and then moving shards between nodes to reduce the weight of the
heavier nodes and increase the weight of the lighter ones. The cluster is
balanced when there is no possible shard movement that can bring the weight of
any node closer to the weight of any other node by more than a configurable
threshold.

The weight of a node depends on the number of shards it holds and on the total
estimated resource usage of those shards expressed in terms of the size of the
shard on disk and the number of threads needed to support write traffic to the
shard. {es} estimates the resource usage of shards belonging to data streams
when they are created by a rollover. The estimated disk size of the new shard
is the mean size of the other shards in the data stream. The estimated write
load of the new shard is a weighted average of the actual write loads of recent
shards in the data stream. Shards that do not belong to the write index of a
data stream have an estimated write load of zero.

The following settings control how {es} combines these values into an overall
measure of each node's weight.

`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.shard`::
(float, <<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Defines the weight factor for the total number of shards allocated to each node.
Defaults to `0.45f`. Raising this value increases the tendency of {es} to
equalize the total number of shards across nodes ahead of the other balancing
variables.

`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.index`::
(float, <<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Defines the weight factor for the number of shards per index allocated to each
node. Defaults to `0.55f`. Raising this value increases the tendency of {es} to
equalize the number of shards of each index across nodes ahead of the other
balancing variables.

`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.disk_usage`::
(float, <<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Defines the weight factor for balancing shards according to their predicted disk
size in bytes. Defaults to `2e-11f`. Raising this value increases the tendency
of {es} to equalize the total disk usage across nodes ahead of the other
balancing variables.

`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.write_load`::
(float, <<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
Defines the weight factor for the write load of each shard, in terms of the
estimated number of indexing threads needed by the shard. Defaults to `10.0f`.
Raising this value increases the tendency of {es} to equalize the total write
load across nodes ahead of the other balancing variables.

`cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold`::
(float, <<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The minimum improvement in weight which triggers a rebalancing shard movement.
Defaults to `1.0f`. Raising this value will cause {es} to stop rebalancing
shards sooner, leaving the cluster in a more unbalanced state.

NOTE: Regardless of the result of the balancing algorithm, rebalancing might
not be allowed due to allocation rules such as forced awareness and allocation
filtering.

== HTTP

The http module allows to expose *elasticsearch* APIs
over HTTP.

The http mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that
there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using
asynchronous communication for HTTP is solving the

When possible, consider using

when connecting for better performance and try to get your favorite
client not to do

=== Settings

The following are the settings that can be configured for HTTP:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description
|`http.port` |A bind port range. Defaults to `9200-9300`.

|`http.max_content_length` |The max content of an HTTP request. Defaults
to `100mb`

|`http.max_initial_line_length` |The max length of an HTTP URL. Defaults
to `4kb`

|`http.compression` |Support for compression when possible (with
Accept-Encoding). Defaults to `false`.

|`http.compression_level` |Defines the compression level to use.
Defaults to `6`.

|`http.cors.enabled` |Enable or disable cross-origin resource sharing,
i.e. whether a browser on another origin can do requests to
Elasticsearch. Defaults to `true`.

|`http.cors.allow-origin` |Which origins to allow. Defaults to `*`,
i.e. any origin.

|`http.cors.max-age` |Browsers send a "preflight" OPTIONS-request to
determine CORS settings. `max-age` defines how long the result should
be cached for. Defaults to `1728000` (20 days)

|`http.cors.allow-methods` |Which methods to allow. Defaults to
`OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`.

|`http.cors.allow-headers` |Which headers to allow. Defaults to
`X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Content-Length`.


|=======================================================================

It also uses the common
<<modules-network,network settings>>.

=== Disable HTTP

The http module can be completely disabled and not started by setting
`http.enabled` to `false`. This make sense when creating non
<<modules-node,data nodes>> which accept HTTP
requests, and communicate with data nodes using the internal
<<modules-transport,transport>>.

== HTTP

The http module allows to expose *elasticsearch* APIs
over HTTP.

The http mechanism is completely asynchronous in nature, meaning that
there is no blocking thread waiting for a response. The benefit of using
asynchronous communication for HTTP is solving the

When possible, consider using

when connecting for better performance and try to get your favorite
client not to do

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description
|`http.port` |A bind port range. Defaults to `9200-9300`.

|`http.max_content_length` |The max content of an HTTP request. Defaults
to `100mb`

|`http.max_initial_line_length` |The max length of an HTTP URL. Defaults
to `4kb`

|`http.compression` |Support for compression when possible (with

|=======================================================================

It also shares the uses the common
<<modules-network,network settings>>.

=== Disable HTTP

The http module can be completely disabled and not started by setting
`http.enabled` to `false`. This make sense when creating non
<<modules-node,data nodes>> which accept HTTP
requests, and communicate with data nodes using the internal
<<modules-transport,transport>>.

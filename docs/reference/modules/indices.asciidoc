[[modules-indices]]
== Indices

The indices module allow to control settings that are globally managed
for all indices.

[float]
[[buffer]]
=== Indexing Buffer

The indexing buffer setting allows to control how much memory will be
allocated for the indexing process. It is a global setting that bubbles
down to all the different shards allocated on a specific node.

The `indices.memory.index_buffer_size` accepts either a percentage or a
byte size value. It defaults to `10%`, meaning that `10%` of the total
memory allocated to a node will be used as the indexing buffer size.
This amount is then divided between all the different shards. Also, if
percentage is used, it is possible to set `min_index_buffer_size` (defaults to
`48mb`) and `max_index_buffer_size` (defaults to unbounded).

The `indices.memory.min_shard_index_buffer_size` allows to set a hard
lower limit for the memory allocated per shard for its own indexing
buffer. It defaults to `4mb`.

[float]
[[indices-ttl]]
=== TTL interval

You can dynamically set the `indices.ttl.interval`, which allows to set how
often expired documents will be automatically deleted. The default value
is 60s.

The deletion orders are processed by bulk. You can set
`indices.ttl.bulk_size` to fit your needs. The default value is 10000.

[float]
[[recovery]]
=== Recovery

The following settings can be set to manage the recovery policy:

[horizontal]
`indices.recovery.concurrent_streams`::
    defaults to `3`.

`indices.recovery.concurrent_small_file_streams`::
    defaults to `2`.

`indices.recovery.file_chunk_size`::
    defaults to `512kb`.

`indices.recovery.translog_ops`::
    defaults to `1000`.

`indices.recovery.translog_size`::
    defaults to `512kb`.

`indices.recovery.compress`::
    defaults to `true`.

`indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`::
    defaults to `40mb`.

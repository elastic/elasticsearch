== Scripting

The scripting module enables you to use scripts to evaluate custom
expressions. For example, you could use a script to return "script fields"
as part of a search request or evaluate a custom score for a query.

TIP: Elasticsearch now has a built-in scripting language called _Painless_
that provides a more secure alternative for implementing
scripts for Elasticsearch. We encourage you to try it out --
for more information, see <<modules-scripting-painless, Painless Scripting Language>>.

The default scripting language is http://groovy-lang.org/[groovy].
Additional `lang` plugins enable you to run scripts written in other languages.
Everywhere a script can be used, you can include a `lang` parameter
to specify the language of the script.

=== General-purpose languages:

These languages can be used for any purpose in the scripting APIs,
and give the most flexibility.

These languages are less flexible, but typically have higher performance for
certain tasks.

.Scripts and security
=================================================

Languages that are sandboxed are designed with security in mind. However, non-
sandboxed languages can be a security issue, please read
<<modules-scripting-security, Scripting and security>> for more details.

[[modules-scripting-security]]
=== Scripting and security

While Elasticsearch contributors make every effort to prevent scripts from
running amok, security is something best done in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)[layers] because
all software has bugs and it is important to minimize the risk of failure in
any security layer. Find below rules of thumb for how to keep Elasticsearch
from being a vulnerability.

[float]
=== Do not run as root
First and foremost, never run Elasticsearch as the `root` user as this would
allow any successful effort to circumvent the other security layers to do
*anything* on your server. Elasticsearch will refuse to start if it detects
that it is running as `root` but this is so important that it is worth double
and triple checking.

[float]
=== Do not expose Elasticsearch directly to users
Do not expose Elasticsearch directly to users, instead have an application
make requests on behalf of users. If this is not possible, have an application
to sanitize requests from users. If *that* is not possible then have some
mechanism to track which users did what. Understand that it is quite possible
to write a <<search, `_search`>> that overwhelms Elasticsearch and brings down
the cluster. All such searches should be considered bugs and the Elasticsearch
contributors make an effort to prevent this but they are still possible.

[float]
=== Do not expose Elasticsearch directly to the Internet
Do not expose Elasticsearch to the Internet, instead have an application
make requests on behalf of the Internet. Do not entertain the thought of having
an application "sanitize" requests to Elasticsearch. Understand that it is
possible for a sufficiently determined malicious user to write searches that
overwhelm the Elasticsearch cluster and bring it down. For example:

Good:

* Users type text into a search box and the text is sent directly to a
<<query-dsl-match-query>>, <<query-dsl-match-query-phrase>>,
<<query-dsl-simple-query-string-query>>, or any of the <<search-suggesters>>.
* Running a script with any of the above queries that was written as part of
the application development process.
* Running a script with `params` provided by users.
* User actions makes documents with a fixed structure.

Bad:

* Users can write arbitrary scripts, queries, `_search` requests.
* User actions make documents with structure defined by users.

[float]
[[modules-scripting-security-do-no-weaken]]
=== Do not weaken script security settings
By default Elasticsearch will run inline, stored, and filesystem scripts for
sandboxed languages, namely the scripting language Painless, the template
language Mustache, and the expression language Expressions. These *ought* to be
safe to expose to trusted users and to your application servers because they
have strong security sandboxes. By default Elasticsearch will only run
filesystem scripts for non-sandboxed languages and enabling them is a poor
choice because:
1. This drops a layer of security, leaving only Elasticsearch's builtin
<<modules-scripting-other-layers, security layers>>.
2. Non-sandboxed scripts have unchecked access to Elasticsearch's internals and
can cause all kinds of trouble if misused.


[float]
[[modules-scripting-other-layers]]
=== Other security layers
In addition to user privileges and script sandboxing Elasticsearch uses the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html[Java Security Manager]
and native security tools as additional layers of security.

As part of its startup sequence Elasticsearch enables the Java Security Manager
which limits the actions that can be taken by portions of the code. Painless
uses this to limit the actions that generated Painless scripts can take,
preventing them from being able to do things like write files and listen to
sockets.

Elasticsearch uses
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp[seccomp] in Linux,
https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/osx-sandboxing-design[Seatbelt]
in macOS, and
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684147[ActiveProcessLimit]
on Windows to prevent Elasticsearch from forking or executing other processes.

Below this we describe the security settings for scripts and how you can
change from the defaults described above. You should be very, very careful
when allowing more than the defaults. Any extra permissions weakens the total
security of the Elasticsearch deployment.

[[allowed-script-types-setting]]
[float]
=== Allowed script types setting

By default all script types are allowed to be executed.  This can be modified using the
setting `script.allowed_types`.  Only the types specified as part of the setting will be
allowed to be executed.  To specify no types are allowed, set `script.allowed_types` to
be `none`.

[source,yaml]
----
script.allowed_types: inline <1>
----
<1> This will allow only inline scripts to be executed but not stored scripts
(or any other types).

[[allowed-script-contexts-setting]]
[float]
=== Allowed script contexts setting

By default all script contexts are allowed to be executed.  This can be modified using the
setting `script.allowed_contexts`.  Only the contexts specified as part of the setting will
be allowed to be executed.  To specify no contexts are allowed, set `script.allowed_contexts`
to be `none`.

[source,yaml]
----
script.allowed_contexts: search, update <1>
----
<1> This will allow only search and update scripts to be executed but not
aggs or plugin scripts (or any other contexts).

[[deprecated-script=settings]]
[float]
=== Deprecated script settings

The following settings have all been deprecated and will be removed in 6.0:

 * <<security-script-source>>
 * <<security-script-context>>
 * <<security-script-fine>>

Use the following instead:

 * <<allowed-script-types-setting>>
 * <<allowed-script-contexts-setting>>

[[security-script-source]]
[float]
=== Script source settings

Which scripts Elasticsearch will execute where is controlled by settings
starting with `scripts.`. The simplest settings allow scripts to be enabled
or disabled based on where they are stored. For example:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.inline: false  <1>
script.stored: false  <2>
script.file:   true   <3>
-----------------------------------
<1> Refuse to run scripts provided inline in the API.
<2> Refuse to run scripts stored using the API.
<3> Run scripts found on the filesystem in `/etc/elasticsearch/scripts`
(rpm or deb) or `config/scripts` (zip or tar).

NOTE: These settings override the defaults mentioned
<<modules-scripting-security-do-no-weaken, above>>. Recreating the defaults
requires more fine grained settings described <<security-script-fine, below>>.

[[security-script-context]]
[float]
=== Script context settings

Scripting may also be enabled or disabled in different contexts in the
Elasticsearch API. The supported contexts are:

[horizontal]
`aggs`::    Aggregations
`search`::  Search api, Percolator API and Suggester API
`update`::  Update api
`plugin`::  Any plugin that makes use of scripts under the generic `plugin` category

Plugins can also define custom operations that they use scripts for instead
of using the generic `plugin` category. Those operations can be referred to
in the following form: `${pluginName}_${operation}`.

The following example disables scripting for `update` and `plugin` operations,
regardless of the script source or language. Scripts can still be executed
from sandboxed languages as part of `aggregations`, `search` and plugins
execution though, as the above defaults still get applied.

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.update: false
script.plugin: false
-----------------------------------

[[security-script-fine]]
[float]
=== Fine-grained script settings

First, the high-level script settings described above are applied in order
(context settings have precedence over source settings). Then fine-grained
settings which include the script language take precedence over any high-level
settings. They have two forms:

[source,yaml]
------------------------
script.engine.{lang}.{inline|file|stored}.{context}: true|false
------------------------

And

[source,yaml]
------------------------
script.engine.{lang}.{inline|file|stored}: true|false
------------------------

For example:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------
script.inline: false <1>
script.stored: false <1>
script.file:   false <1>

script.engine.painless.inline:          true <2>
script.engine.painless.stored.search:   true <3>
script.engine.painless.stored.aggs:     true <3>

script.engine.mustache.stored.search:   true <4>
-----------------------------------
<1> Disable all scripting from any source.
<2> Allow inline Painless scripts for all operations.
<3> Allow stored Painless scripts to be used for search and aggregations.
<4> Allow stored Mustache templates to be used for search.

[[java-security-manager]]
[float]
=== Java Security Manager

As mentioned above, Elasticsearch runs with the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/security.html[Java Security Manager]
enabled by default. The security policy in Elasticsearch locks down the
permissions granted to each class to the bare minimum required to operate.
The benefit of doing this is that it severely limits the attack vectors
available to a hacker.

Restricting permissions is particularly important for non-sandboxed scripting
languages like Groovy and Javascript which are designed to do anything that can
be done in Java itself, including writing to the file system, opening sockets
to remote servers, etc.

[float]
=== Script Classloader Whitelist

Groovy makes an effort to prevent loading classes which do not appear in a
hardcoded whitelist that can be found in
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/{branch}/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/script/ClassPermission.java[`org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission`].


In a script, attempting to load a class that does not appear in the whitelist
_may_ result in a `ClassNotFoundException`, for instance this script:

[source,js]
------------------------------
GET _search
{
  "script_fields": {
    "the_hour": {
      "script": "use(java.math.BigInteger); new BigInteger(1)"
    }
  }
}
------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]
// TEST[catch:request]

will return the following exception:

[source,js]
------------------------------
{
  "reason": {
    "type": "script_exception",
    "reason": "failed to run inline script [use(java.math.BigInteger); new BigInteger(1)] using lang [groovy]",
    "caused_by": {
      "type": "no_class_def_found_error",
      "reason": "java/math/BigInteger",
      "caused_by": {
        "type": "class_not_found_exception",
        "reason": "java.math.BigInteger"
      }
    }
  }
}
------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
// This isn't exactly the error we get but it isn't worth fixing it because
// this is being dropped in master anyway.

However, classloader issues may also result in more difficult to interpret
exceptions.  For instance, this script:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------
use(groovy.time.TimeCategory); new Date(123456789).format('HH')
------------------------------

Returns the following exception:

[source,js]
------------------------------
{
  "reason": {
    "type": "script_exception",
    "reason": "failed to run inline script [use(groovy.time.TimeCategory); new Date(123456789).format('HH')] using lang [groovy]",
    "caused_by": {
      "type": "missing_property_exception",
      "reason": "No such property: groovy for class: 8d45f5c1a07a1ab5dda953234863e283a7586240"
    }
  }
}
------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

== Dealing with Java Security Manager issues

If you encounter issues with the Java Security Manager, you have two options
for resolving these issues:

[float]
=== Fix the security problem

The safest and most secure long term solution is to change the code causing
the security issue.  We recognise that this may take time to do correctly and
so we provide the following two alternatives.

[float]
=== Customising the classloader whitelist

The classloader whitelist can be customised by tweaking the local Java
Security Policy either:

* system wide: `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.policy`,
* for just the `elasticsearch` user: `/home/elasticsearch/.java.policy`
* by adding a system property to the <<jvm-options,jvm.options>> configuration: `-Djava.security.policy=someURL`, or
* via the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable with `-Djava.security.policy=someURL`:
+
[source,js]
---------------------------------
export ES_JAVA_OPTS="${ES_JAVA_OPTS} -Djava.security.policy=file:///path/to/my.policy`
./bin/elasticsearch
---------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

Permissions may be granted at the class, package, or global level.  For instance:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
grant {
    permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "java.util.Base64"; // allow class
    permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "java.util.*"; // allow package
    permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "*"; // allow all (disables filtering basically)
};
----------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

Here is an example of how to enable the `groovy.time.TimeCategory` class:

[source,js]
----------------------------------
grant {
    permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "java.lang.Class";
    permission org.elasticsearch.script.ClassPermission "groovy.time.TimeCategory";
};
----------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

[TIP]
======================================

Before adding classes to the whitelist, consider the security impact that it
will have on Elasticsearch. Do you really need an extra class or can your code
be rewritten in a more secure way?

It is quite possible that we have not whitelisted a generically useful and
safe class. If you have a class that you think should be whitelisted by
default, please open an issue on GitHub and we will consider the impact of
doing so.

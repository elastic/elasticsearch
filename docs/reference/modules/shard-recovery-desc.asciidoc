Shard recovery is the process of initializing a shard copy, such as restoring a
primary shard from a snapshot or creating a replica shard from a primary shard.
When a shard recovery completes, the recovered shard is available for search
and indexing.

Recovery automatically occurs during the following processes:

* When creating an index for the first time.
* When a node rejoins the cluster and starts up any missing primary shard copies using the data that it holds in its data path.
* Creation of new replica shard copies from the primary.
* Relocation of a shard copy to a different node in the same cluster.
* A <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,snapshot restore>> operation.
* A <<indices-clone-index,clone>>, <<indices-shrink-index,shrink>>, or
<<indices-split-index,split>> operation.

You can determine the cause of a shard recovery using the <<indices-recovery,recovery>> or  <<cat-recovery,cat recovery>> APIs.

Each monitored {stack} component is considered unique in the cluster based on
its persistent UUID, which is written to the <<path-settings,`path.data`>>
directory when the node or instance starts.

Monitoring documents are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each
{stack} component at a specified collection interval. If you want to alter how
these documents are structured or stored, refer to <<config-monitoring-indices>>.

You can use {agent} or {metricbeat} to collect monitoring data and to ship it
directly to the monitoring cluster.

To learn how to collect monitoring data, refer to:

* One of the following topics depending on how you want to collect monitoring
data from {es}:
** <<configuring-elastic-agent>>: Uses a single agent to
gather logs and metrics. Can be managed from a central location in {fleet}.
** <<configuring-metricbeat>>: Uses a lightweight {beats}
shipper to gather metrics. May be preferred if you have an existing investment
in {beats} or are not yet ready to use {agent}.
** <<collecting-monitoring-data>>: Uses internal exporters to
gather metrics. Not recommended. If you have previously configured legacy
collection methods, you should migrate to using {agent} or {metricbeat}.

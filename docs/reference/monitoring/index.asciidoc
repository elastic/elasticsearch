{stack-monitor-features} give you insight into the operation of {es}, {ls},
{kib}, and Beats. All of the monitoring metrics are stored in {es}, which
enables you to easily visualize the data from {kib}. From the {kib} Stack
Monitoring UI, you can spot issues at a glance and delve into the system
behavior over time to diagnose operational issues. In addition to the built-in
status warnings, you can set up custom alerts based on the data in the
monitoring indices.

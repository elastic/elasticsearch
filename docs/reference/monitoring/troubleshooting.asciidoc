[[monitoring-troubleshooting-no-data]]
=== No monitoring data is visible in {kib}

*Symptoms*:
There is no information about your cluster on the *Stack Monitoring* page in
{kib}.

*Resolution*:
Check whether the appropriate indices exist on the monitoring cluster. For
example, use the <<cat-indices,cat indices>> command to verify that
there is a `.monitoring-kibana*` index for your {kib} monitoring data and a
`.monitoring-es*` index for your {es} monitoring data. If you are collecting
monitoring data by using {metricbeat} the indices have `-mb` in their names. If
the indices do not exist, review your configuration. For example, see
<<monitoring-production>>.

[[monitoring-troubleshooting-uuid]]
=== Monitoring data for some {stack} nodes or instances is missing from {kib}

*Symptoms*:
The *Stack Monitoring* page in {kib} does not show information for some nodes or 
instances in your cluster.

*Resolution*:
Verify that the missing items have unique UUIDs. Each {es} node, {ls} node,
{kib} instance, Beat instance, and APM Server is considered unique based on its
persistent UUID, which is found in its `path.data` directory. Alternatively, you
can find the UUIDs in the product logs at startup.

In some cases, you can also retrieve this information via APIs:

* For Beat instances, use the HTTP endpoint to retrieve the `uuid` property.
For example, refer to
{filebeat-ref}/http-endpoint.html[Configure an HTTP endpoint for {filebeat} metrics].
* For {kib} instances, use the
{kibana-ref}/access.html#status[status endpoint] to retrieve the `uuid` property.
* For {ls} nodes, use the
{logstash-ref}/monitoring-logstash.html[monitoring APIs root resource] to
retrieve the `id` property.

TIP: When you install {es}, {ls}, {kib}, APM Server, or Beats, their `path.data`
directory should be non-existent or empty; do not copy this directory from other
installations.

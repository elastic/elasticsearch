= Get ready for production

`statement of when this matters goes here`

To make Elasticsearch production-ready, you need to consider the following: 

[discrete]
== Your deployment method

Elastic offers several methods of deploying Elasticsearch. Each method offers different levels of control over your deployment. Some methods allow you to centrally manage multiple deployments or clusters.

Refer to the documentation for each deployment method for detailed information about the available features.

== Cluster or deployment design

{es} is built to be always available and to scale with your needs. It does this using a distributed architecture. By distributing your cluster, you can keep Elastic online and responsive to requests. Consider the following elements when you design your cluster or deployment.

[discrete]
=== Where to start

Many {es} options come with different performance considerations and trade-offs. The best way to determine the
optimal configuration for your use case is through https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2016/sf/quantitative-cluster-sizing[testing with your own data and queries]. When you understand the shape and size of your data, as well as your use case, you can make informed decisions about how to configure your cluster. 

After you understand your data, use case, and organizational priorities, you can review the guidelines in our <<how-to,Optimizations>> topics to learn how to tune your cluster to meet your needs.

[discrete]
=== Data retention strategy

include::{es-ref-dir}/lifecycle-options.asciidoc[]

You should determine how long you need to retain your data and how you will manage it.

something about when to use which one?

[discrete]
=== Node and shard configuration

When you move to production, you need to introduce multiple nodes and shards to your cluster. Nodes and shards are what make Elasticsearch distributed and scalable. The size and number of these nodes and shards depends on your data, your use case, and your budget. 

The way that you manage your nodes and shards depends on your deployment method:

* If you're using a *manual on-premise deployment*, then you need to size and manage your nodes and shards manually.

* If you're using *Elastic Cloud Hosted* or *Elastic Cloud Enterprise*, then you can choose from different deployment types to apply sensible defaults for your use case, or set the size of your data on a per-zone, per-tier basis. These products can also autoscale resources in response to workload changes.
** *Elastic Cloud Hosted resources*:

*** {cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[Deployment autoscaling]
** *Elastic Cloud Enterprise resources*:
*** {ece-ref}/ece-stack-getting-started.html[Working with deployments]
*** {ece-ref}/ece-autoscaling.html[Deployment autoscaling]

* If you're using *Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes*, then you can define {eck-ref}/k8s-autoscaling.html[autoscaling policies] and use the {eck-ref}/k8s-stateless-autoscaling.html[Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler] to scale different elements in your cluster based on your workload.

=== High availability and disaster recovery

// each of these topics needs to be reviewed to mark elements related/unrelated to each deployment type

[discrete]
=== Tuning your cluster

{es} offers many options that allow you to configure your cluster to meet your organization's goals, requirements, and restrictions. Review these guidelines to learn how to tune your cluster to meet your needs. These guidelines cover elements from hardware provision to query optimization.

* <<tune-for-indexing-speed,Tune for indexing speed>>
* <<tune-for-search-speed,Tune for search speed>>
* <<tune-for-disk-usage,Tune for disk usage>>
* <<use-elasticsearch-for-time-series-data,Tune for time series data>>  
// do we need this last topic anymore? Is this the best version we have? It's not referenced anywhere. it also isn't updated to use data stream lifecycle

// each of these topics needs to be reviewed to mark elements related/unrelated to each deployment type

[discrete]
== Security

The {stack} is composed of many moving parts. There are the {es} nodes that form the cluster, plus {ls} instances, {kib} instances, {beats} agents, Elastic Agents, and clients all communicating with the cluster. 

In the case of *Elastic Cloud Hosted*, *Elastic Cloud Enterprise*, or *Elastic Cloud Serverless* deployments, you also need to consider the security of the Elastic Cloud installation or organization. You also can optionally manage deployment-level user roles from the Cloud UI.

Security comprises the following concerns: 

* *Preventing unauthorized access* with password protection, role-based access control, and IP filtering.
* *Preserving the integrity of your data* with SSL/TLS encryption.
* *Maintaining an audit trail* so you know who's doing what to your cluster and the data it stores.

The technologies and methods that you can use to address these concerns are different depending on your deployment method.

Review the following topics to design your security strategy:

== Monitoring

As with any enterprise system, you need tools to secure, manage, and monitor your Elasticsearch clusters. Security,
monitoring, and administrative features that are integrated into Elasticsearch enable you to use {kibana-ref}/introduction.html[Kibana] as a
control center for managing a cluster.

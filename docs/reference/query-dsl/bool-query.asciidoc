=== Boolean query
++++
<titleabbrev>Boolean</titleabbrev>
++++

A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other
queries. The bool query maps to Lucene `BooleanQuery`. It is built using
one or more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence. The
occurrence types are:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Occur |Description
|`must` |The clause (query) must appear in matching documents and will
contribute to the score.

|`filter` |The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. However unlike
`must` the score of the query will be ignored. Filter clauses are executed
in <<query-filter-context,filter context>>, meaning that scoring is ignored
and clauses are considered for caching.

|`should` |The clause (query) should appear in the matching document.

|`must_not` |The clause (query) must not appear in the matching
documents.  Clauses are executed in <<query-filter-context,filter context>> meaning
that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching. Because scoring is
ignored, a score of `0` for all documents is returned.
|=======================================================================

The `bool` query takes a _more-matches-is-better_ approach, so the score from
each matching `must` or `should` clause will be added together to provide the
final `_score` for each document.

    "bool" : {
      "must" : {

      "filter": {
        "term" : { "tag" : "tech" }

==== Using `minimum_should_match`

You can use the `minimum_should_match` parameter to specify the number or
percentage of `should` clauses returned documents _must_ match.

If the `bool` query includes at least one `should` clause and no `must` or
`filter` clauses, the default value is `1`.
Otherwise, the default value is `0`.

For other valid values, see the
<<query-dsl-minimum-should-match, `minimum_should_match` parameter>>.

[[score-bool-filter]]
==== Scoring with `bool.filter`

Queries specified under the `filter` element have no effect on scoring --
scores are returned as `0`.  Scores are only affected by the query that has
been specified.  For instance, all three of the following queries return
all documents where the `status` field contains the term `active`.

This first query assigns a score of `0` to all documents, as no scoring
query has been specified:

[source,console]
---------------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "term": {
          "status": "active"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
---------------------------------

This `bool` query has a `match_all` query, which assigns a score of `1.0` to
all documents.

[source,console]
---------------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": {
        "match_all": {}
      },
      "filter": {
        "term": {
          "status": "active"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
---------------------------------

This `constant_score` query behaves in exactly the same way as the second example above.
The `constant_score` query assigns a score of `1.0` to all documents matched
by the filter.

[source,console]
---------------------------------
GET _search
{
  "query": {
    "constant_score": {
      "filter": {
        "term": {
          "status": "active"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
---------------------------------

==== Using named queries to see which clauses matched

If you need to know which of the clauses in the bool query matched the documents
returned from the query, you can use
<<request-body-search-queries-and-filters,named queries>> to assign a name to
each clause.

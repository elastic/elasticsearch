=== Geo Distance Range Query

deprecated[5.0.0,Elasticsearch will continue to support geo_distance_range queries on indexes created
prior to 5.0.0. Range searches on indexes created in 5.0.0 and later will no longer be supported.
Distance aggregations or sorting should be used instead. Alternatively a boolean query using MUST and 
MUST_NOT geo_distange query clauses can be used to achieve a similiar effect.]

Filters documents that exists within a range from a specific point:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "bool" : {
            "must" : {
                "match_all" : {}
            },
            "filter" : {
                "geo_distance_range" : {
                    "from" : "200km",
                    "to" : "400km",
                    "pin.location" : {
                        "lat" : 40,
                        "lon" : -70
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Supports the same point location parameter and query options as the
<<query-dsl-geo-distance-query,geo_distance>>
filter. And also support the common parameters for range (lt, lte, gt,
gte, from, to, include_upper and include_lower).

[float]
==== Ignore Unmapped

When set to `true` the `ignore_unmapped` option will ignore an unmapped field
and will not match any documents for this query. This can be useful when
querying multiple indexes which might have different mappings. When set to
`false` (the default value) the query will throw an exception if the field
is not mapped.

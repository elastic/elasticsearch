== Geo queries

Elasticsearch supports two types of geo data:
<<geo-point,`geo_point`>> fields which support lat/lon pairs, and
<<geo-shape,`geo_shape`>> fields, which support points,
lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons, etc.

The queries in this group are:

<<query-dsl-geo-bounding-box-query,`geo_bounding_box`>> query::
Finds documents with geoshapes or geopoints which intersect the specified rectangle.

<<query-dsl-geo-distance-query,`geo_distance`>> query::
Finds documents with geoshapes or geopoints within the specified distance of a central point.

<<query-dsl-geo-grid-query,`geo_grid`>> query::
Finds documents with:
* Geoshapes or geopoints which intersect the specified geohash
* Geoshapes or geopoints which intersect the specified map tile
* Geopoints which intersect the specified H3 bin

<<query-dsl-geo-polygon-query,`geo_polygon`>> query::
Find documents with geoshapes or geopoints which intersect the specified polygon.

<<query-dsl-geo-shape-query,`geo_shape`>> query::
Finds documents with geoshapes or geopoints which are related to the specified geoshape.
Possible spatial relationships to specify are: intersects, contained, within and disjoint.

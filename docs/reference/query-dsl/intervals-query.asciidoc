=== Intervals query

An `intervals` query allows fine-grained control over the order and proximity of
matching terms.  Matching rules are constructed from a small set of definitions,
and the rules are then applied to terms from a particular `field`.

The definitions produce sequences of intervals that span terms in a
body of text.  These intervals can be further combined and filtered by
parent sources.

The example below will search for the phrase `my favourite food` appearing
before the terms `hot` and `water` or `cold` and `porridge` in any order, in
the field `my_text`

POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "all_of" : {
          "ordered" : true,
          "intervals" : [
            {
              "match" : {
                "query" : "my favourite food",
                "max_gaps" : 0,
                "ordered" : true
              }
            },
            {
              "any_of" : {
                "intervals" : [
                  { "match" : { "query" : "hot water" } },
                  { "match" : { "query" : "cold porridge" } }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "boost" : 2.0,
        "_name" : "favourite_food"
      }
    }
  }
}

// CONSOLE

In the above example, the text `my favourite food is cold porridge` would
match because the two intervals matching `my favourite food` and `cold
porridge` appear in the correct order, but the text `when it's cold my
favourite food is porridge` would not match, because the interval matching
`cold porridge` starts before the interval matching `my favourite food`.

[[intervals-match]]
==== `match`

The `match` rule matches analyzed text, and takes the following parameters:

[horizontal]
`query`::
The text to match.
`max_gaps`::
Specify a maximum number of gaps between the terms in the text.  Terms that
appear further apart than this will not match. If unspecified, or set to -1,
then there is no width restriction on the match.  If set to 0 then the terms
must appear next to each other.
`ordered`::
Whether or not the terms must appear in their specified order.  Defaults to
`false`
`analyzer`::
Which analyzer should be used to analyze terms in the `query`.  By
default, the search analyzer of the top-level field will be used.
`filter`::
An optional <<interval_filter,interval filter>>

[[intervals-all_of]]
==== `all_of`

`all_of` returns returns matches that span a combination of other rules.

[horizontal]
`intervals`::
An array of rules to combine.  All rules must produce a match in a
document for the overall source to match.
`max_gaps`::
Specify a maximum number of gaps between the rules.  Combinations that match
across a distance greater than this will not match.  If set to -1 or
unspecified, there is no restriction on this distance.  If set to 0, then the
matches produced by the rules must all appear immediately next to each other.
`ordered`::
Whether the intervals produced by the rules should appear in the order in
which they are specified.  Defaults to `false`
`filter`::
An optional <<interval_filter,interval filter>>

[[intervals-any_of]]
==== `any_of` source

The `or` rule will match any of its nested sub-rules.

[horizontal]
`intervals`::
An array of rules to match
`filter`::
An optional <<interval_filter,interval filter>>

[[interval_filter]]
==== filters

You can filter intervals produced by any rules by their relation to the
intervals produced by another rule.  The following example will return
documents that have the words `hot` and `porridge` within 10 positions
of each other, without the word `salty` in between:

  "query": {
    "intervals" : {
      "my_text" : {
        "match" : {
          "query" : "hot porridge",
          "max_gaps" : 10,
          "filter" : {
            "not_containing" : {
              "match" : {

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The following filters are available:
[horizontal]
`containing`::
Produces intervals that contain an interval from the filter rule
`contained_by`::
Produces intervals that are contained by an interval from the filter rule
`not_containing`::
Produces intervals that do not contain an interval from the filter rule
`not_contained_by`::
Produces intervals that are not contained by an interval from the filter rule
`not_overlapping`::
Produces intervals that do not overlap with an interval from the filter rule

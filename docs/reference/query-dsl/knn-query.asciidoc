=== Knn query
++++
<titleabbrev>Knn</titleabbrev>
++++

Finds the _k_ nearest vectors to a query vector, as measured by a similarity
metric. _knn_ query finds nearest vectors through approximate search on indexed
dense_vectors. The preferred way to do approximate kNN search is through the
<<knn-search,top level knn section>> of a search request. _knn_ query is reserved for
expert cases, where there is a need to combine this query with other queries, or
perform a kNN search against a <<semantic-text, semantic_text>> field.

[[knn-query-top-level-parameters]]
==== Top-level parameters for `knn`

`field`::
+
--
(Required, string) The name of the vector field to search against. Must be a
<<index-vectors-knn-search, `dense_vector` field with indexing enabled>>, or a
<<semantic-text, `semantic_text` field>> with a compatible dense vector inference model.
--

`query_vector`::
+
--
(Optional, array of floats or string) Query vector. Must have the same number of dimensions
as the vector field you are searching against. Must be either an array of floats or a hex-encoded byte vector.
Either this or `query_vector_builder` must be provided.
--

`query_vector_builder`::
+
--
(Optional, object) Query vector builder.
include::{es-ref-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=knn-query-vector-builder]
If all queried fields are of type <<semantic-text, semantic_text>>, the inference ID associated with the `semantic_text` field may be inferred.
--

`k`::
+
--
(Optional, integer) The number of nearest neighbors to return from each shard.
{es} collects `k` results from each shard, then merges them to find the global top results.
This value must be less than or equal to `num_candidates`. Defaults to search request size.
--

`num_candidates`::
+
--
(Optional, integer) The number of nearest neighbor candidates to consider per shard
while doing knn search. Cannot exceed 10,000. Increasing `num_candidates` tends to
improve the accuracy of the final results.
Defaults to `1.5 * k` if `k` is set, or `1.5 * size` if `k` is not set.
--

`filter`::
+
--
(Optional, query object) Query to filter the documents that can match.
The kNN search will return the top documents that also match this filter.
The value can be a single query or a list of queries. If `filter` is not provided,
all documents are allowed to match.

The filter is a pre-filter, meaning that it is applied **during** the approximate
kNN search to ensure that `num_candidates` matching documents are returned.
--

`similarity`::
+
--
(Optional, float) The minimum similarity required for a document to be considered
a match. The similarity value calculated relates to the raw
<<dense-vector-similarity, `similarity`>> used. Not the document score. The matched
documents are then scored according to <<dense-vector-similarity, `similarity`>>
and the provided `boost` is applied.
--

include::{es-ref-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=knn-rescore-vector]


`boost`::
+
--
(Optional, float) Floating point number used to multiply the
scores of matched documents. This value cannot be negative. Defaults to `1.0`.
--

`_name`::
+
--
(Optional, string) Name field to identify the query
--

[[knn-query-filtering]]
==== Pre-filters and post-filters in knn query

There are two ways to filter documents that match a kNN query:

. **pre-filtering** – filter is applied during the approximate kNN search
to ensure that `k` matching documents are returned.
. **post-filtering** – filter is applied after the approximate kNN search
completes, which results in fewer than k results, even when there are enough
matching documents.

Pre-filtering is supported through the `filter` parameter of the `knn` query.
Also filters from <<filter-alias,aliases>> are applied as pre-filters.

All other filters found in the Query DSL tree are applied as post-filters.
For example, `knn` query finds the top 3 documents with the nearest vectors
(k=3), which are combined with  `term` filter, that is
post-filtered. The final set of documents will contain only a single document
that passes the post-filter.

[[knn-query-in-hybrid-search]]
==== Hybrid search with knn query
Knn query can be used as a part of hybrid search, where knn query is combined
with other lexical queries. For example, the query below finds documents with
`title` matching `mountain lake`, and combines them with the top 10 documents
that have the closest image vectors to the `query_vector`. The combined documents
are then scored and the top 3 top scored documents are returned.

+
[source,console]
----
POST my-image-index/_search
{
  "size" : 3,
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": {
              "query": "mountain lake",
              "boost": 1
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "knn": {
            "field": "image-vector",
            "query_vector": [-5, 9, -12],
            "k": 10,
            "boost": 2
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

[[knn-query-with-nested-query]]
==== Knn query inside a nested query

`knn` query can be used inside a nested query. The behaviour here is similar
to <<nested-knn-search, top level nested kNN search>>:

* kNN search over nested dense_vectors diversifies the top results over
the top-level document
* `filter`  over the top-level document metadata is supported and acts as a
pre-filter
* `filter` over `nested` field metadata is not supported

A sample query can look like below:

[source,js]
----
{
  "query" : {
    "nested" : {
      "path" : "paragraph",
        "query" : {
          "knn": {
            "query_vector": [
                0.45,
                45
            ],
            "field": "paragraph.vector",
            "num_candidates": 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

[[knn-query-with-semantic-text]]
==== Knn query on a semantic_text field

Elasticsearch supports `knn` query over a <<semantic-text, semantic_text>> field.

Here is an example using the `query_vector_builder`:

[source,js]
----
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "field": "inference_field",
      "k": 10,
      "num_candidates": 100,
      "query_vector_builder": {
        "text_embedding": {
          "model_text": "test"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

Note that for `semantic_text` fields, the `model_id` does not have to be provided as it can be inferred from the `semantic_text` field mapping.

Knn search using query vectors over `semantic_text` fields is also supported, with no change to the API.

[[knn-query-aggregations]]
==== Knn query with aggregations
`knn` query calculates aggregations on top `k` documents from each shard.
Thus, the final results from aggregations contain
`k * number_of_shards` documents. This is different from
the <<knn-search,top level knn section>> where aggregations are
calculated on the global top `k` nearest documents.

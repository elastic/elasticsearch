=== Parent Id Query

added[3.0.0]

The `parent_id` query can be used to find a child document pointing to a particular parent id.

The actual underlying Lucene field that is used to store to what parent id a child document is referring to
is determined by the child type's `_parent` field. This query helps by selecting the right field based
on the specified child type. Example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
    "parent_id" : {
        "type" : "blog_tag",
        "id" : "1"
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==== Parameters

This query has two required parameters:

[horizontal]
`type`::
The child type. This must be a type with `_parent` field.

`id`::
The required parent id select documents must referrer to.

[[query-dsl-pinned-query]]
=== Pinned Query
Promotes selected documents to rank higher than those matching a given query.
This feature is typically used to guide searchers to curated documents that are
promoted over and above any "organic" matches for a search.
The promoted or "pinned" documents are identified using the document IDs stored in
the <<mapping-id-field,`_id`>> field.

==== Example request

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "pinned": {
      "ids": [ "1", "4", "100" ],
      "organic": {
        "match": {
          "description": "iphone"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

==== Pin documents in a specific index

If you're searching over multiple indices, you can pin a document within a specific index using `docs`:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "pinned": {
      "docs": [
        {
          "_index": "my-index-000001", <1>
          "_id": "1"
        },
        {
          "_id": "4" <2>
        }
      ],
      "organic": {
        "match": {
          "description": "iphone"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The document with id `1` from `my-index-000001` will be the first result.
<2> When `_index` is missing, all documents with id `4` from the queried indices will be pinned with the same score.

=== Pinned Query
Promotes selected documents to rank higher than those matching a given query.
This feature is typically used to guide searchers to curated documents that are
promoted over and above any "organic" matches for a search.  
The promoted or "pinned" documents are identified using the document IDs stored in
the <<mapping-id-field,`_id`>> field.

==== Example request

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "pinned" : {
            "ids" : ["1", "4", "100"],
            "organic" : {
            	"match":{
            		"description": "iphone"
            	}
            }
        }
    }
}

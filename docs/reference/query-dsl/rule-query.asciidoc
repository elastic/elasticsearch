=== Rule query

++++
<titleabbrev>Rule</titleabbrev>
++++

[WARNING]
====
`rule_query` was renamed to `rule` in 8.15.0.
The old syntax using `rule_query` and `ruleset_id` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release, so it is strongly advised to migrate existing rule queries to the new API structure.
====

Applies <<query-rules-apis,query rules>> to the query before returning results.
Query rules can be used to promote documents in the manner of a <<query-dsl-pinned-query>> based on matching defined rules, or to identify specific documents to exclude from a contextual result set.
If no matching query rules are defined, the "organic" matches for the query are returned.
All matching rules are applied in the order in which they appear in the query ruleset.
If the same document matches both an `exclude` rule and a `pinned` rule, the document will be excluded.

[NOTE]
====
To use the rule query, you first need a defined set of query rules.
Use the <<query-rules-apis, query rules management APIs>> to create and manage query rules.
For more information and examples see <<search-using-query-rules>>.

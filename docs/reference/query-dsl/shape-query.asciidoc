=== Shape query
++++
<titleabbrev>Shape</titleabbrev>
++++

Queries documents that contain fields indexed using the `shape` type.

Requires the <<shape,`shape` Mapping>>.

The query supports two ways of defining the target shape, either by
providing a whole shape definition, or by referencing the name, or id, of a shape
pre-indexed in another index. Both formats are defined below with
examples.

==== Inline Shape Definition

Similar to the `geo_shape` query, the `shape` query uses
http://www.geojson.org[GeoJSON] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry[Well Known Text]
(WKT) to represent shapes.

Given the following index:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /example
{
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geometry": {
                "type": "shape"
            }
        }
    }
}

POST /example/_doc?refresh
{
    "name": "Lucky Landing",
    "location": {
        "type": "point",
        "coordinates": [1355.400544, 5255.530286]
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TESTSETUP

The following query will find the point using the Elasticsearch's
`envelope` GeoJSON extension:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /example/_search
{
    "query":{
        "shape": {
            "geometry": {
                "shape": {
                    "type": "envelope",
                    "coordinates" : [[1355.0, 5355.0], [1400.0, 5200.0]]
                },
                "relation": "within"
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

==== Pre-Indexed Shape

The Query also supports using a shape which has already been indexed in
another index. This is particularly useful for when
you have a pre-defined list of shapes which are useful to your
application and you want to reference this using a logical name (for
example 'New Zealand') rather than having to provide their coordinates
each time. In this situation it is only necessary to provide:

* `id` - The ID of the document that containing the pre-indexed shape.
* `index` - Name of the index where the pre-indexed shape is. Defaults
to 'shapes'.
* `path` - The field specified as path containing the pre-indexed shape.
Defaults to 'shape'.
* `routing` - The routing of the shape document if required.

The following is an example of using the Filter with a pre-indexed
shape:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /shapes
{
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "geometry": {
                "type": "shape"
            }
        }
    }
}

PUT /shapes/_doc/footprint
{
    "geometry": {
        "type": "envelope",
        "coordinates" : [[1355.0, 5355.0], [1400.0, 5200.0]]
    }
}

GET /example/_search
{
    "query": {
        "shape": {
            "geometry": {
                "indexed_shape": {
                    "index": "shapes",
                    "id": "footprint",
                    "path": "geometry"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

==== Spatial Relations

The following is a complete list of spatial relation operators available:

* `INTERSECTS` - (default) Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
intersects the query geometry.
* `DISJOINT` - Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
has nothing in common with the query geometry.
* `WITHIN` - Return all documents whose `geo_shape` field
is within the query geometry.

[float]
==== Ignore Unmapped

When set to `true` the `ignore_unmapped` option will ignore an unmapped field
and will not match any documents for this query. This can be useful when
querying multiple indexes which might have different mappings. When set to
`false` (the default value) the query will throw an exception if the field
is not mapped.

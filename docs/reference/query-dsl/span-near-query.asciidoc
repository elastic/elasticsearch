=== Span near query
++++
<titleabbrev>Span near</titleabbrev>
++++

Matches spans which are near one another. One can specify _slop_, the
maximum number of intervening unmatched positions, as well as whether
matches are required to be in-order. The span near query maps to Lucene
`SpanNearQuery`. Here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "span_near" : {
            "clauses" : [
                { "span_term" : { "field" : "value1" } },
                { "span_term" : { "field" : "value2" } },
                { "span_term" : { "field" : "value3" } }
            ],
            "slop" : 12,
            "in_order" : false
        }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The `clauses` element is a list of one or more other span type queries
and the `slop` controls the maximum number of intervening unmatched
positions permitted.

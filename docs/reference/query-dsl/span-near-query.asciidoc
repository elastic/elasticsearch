=== Span near query
++++
<titleabbrev>Span near</titleabbrev>
++++

Matches spans which are near one another. One can specify _slop_, the
maximum number of intervening unmatched positions, as well as whether
matches are required to be in-order. Here is an example:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "span_near": {
      "clauses": [
        { "span_term": { "field": "value1" } },
        { "span_term": { "field": "value2" } },
        { "span_term": { "field": "value3" } }
      ],
      "slop": 12,
      "in_order": false
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

The `clauses` element is a list of one or more other span type queries
and the `slop` controls the maximum number of intervening unmatched
positions permitted.

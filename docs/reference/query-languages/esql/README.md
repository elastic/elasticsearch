The ES|QL documentation is composed of static content and generated content.
The static content exists in this directory and can be edited by hand.
However, the sub-directories `_snippets`, `images` and `kibana` contain mostly
generated content.

## Static content

The root `esql` directory and the following two subdirectories contain static content:
* `commands` - contains the static content for the ES|QL commands.
  This content will typically contain mostly include directives for content in the `_snippets` or `images` directories.
* `functions-operators` - contains the static content for the ES|QL functions and operators.
  Again this will contain mostly include directives for content in the `_snippets` or `images` directories.

## Mixed static and generated content

Generated content is created by running the ESQL tests in the `x-pack/plugin/esql` module.
It will be written into three subdirectories of the `esql` directory:

### _snippets

In `_snippets` there are files that can be included within other files using the
[File Inclusion](https://elastic.github.io/docs-builder/syntax/file_inclusion/)
feature of the Elastic Docs V3 system.
Most, but not all, files in this directory are generated.
In particular the directories `_snippets/functions/*` and `_snippets/operators/*`
contain subdirectories that are mostly generated:

* `description` - description of each function scraped from `@FunctionInfo#description`
* `examples` - examples of each function scraped from `@FunctionInfo#examples`
* `parameters` - description of each function's parameters scraped from `@Param`
* `signature` - railroad diagram of the syntax to invoke each function
* `types` - a table of each combination of support type for each parameter. These are generated from tests.
* `layout` - a fully generated description for each function

Most functions can use the generated docs generated in the `layout` directory.
If we need something more custom for the function we can make a file in this
directory that can `include::` any parts of the files above.

To regenerate the files for a function run its tests using gradle.
For example to generate docs for the `CASE` function:
```
./gradlew :x-pack:plugin:esql:test -Dtests.class='CaseTests'
```

To regenerate the files for all functions run all of ESQL's tests using gradle:
```
./gradlew :x-pack:plugin:esql:test
```

#### Commands

The `_snippets/commands` directory contains the content for the ES|QL commands.
There are two subdirectories, one static and one generated:
* `layout` - contains the static content for the ES|QL commands.
  The files in this directory are the main content for the documentation for the commands.
  They are not generated, and so this is the primary place to edit the content, or add new commands.
* `examples` - contains the generated content for the ES|QL commands.
  The files in this directory are generated from the test `CommandsDocsTests` in the `x-pack/plugin/esql` module.
  The structure of the subdirectories mimics the csv-spec files and test tags used in the tests.

Including generated examples in the command documentation is done by using the include directive.

### images

The `images` directory contains `functions` and `operators` sub-directories with
the `*.svg` files used to describe the syntax of each function or operator.
These are all generated by the same tests that generate the functions and operators docs above.

### kibana

The `kibana` directory contains `definition` and `docs` sub-directories that are generated:

* `kibana/definition` - function definitions for kibana's ESQL editor
* `kibana/docs` - the inline docs for kibana

These are also generated as part of the unit tests described above.

### Adding a new command

When adding a new command, for example adding the `CHANGE_POINT` command, do the following:
1. Create a new file in the `_snippets/commands/layout` directory with the name of the command, for example `change_point.md`.
2. Add the content for the command to the file. See other files in this directory for examples.
3. Add the command to the list in `_snippets/lists/processing-commands-md`.
4. Add an include directive to the `commands/processing-commands.md` file to include the new command.
5. Add tested examples to the `_snippets/commands/examples` directory. See below for details.

### Adding examples to commands

When adding tested examples to a command, for example adding an example to the `CHANGE_POINT` command, do the following:
* Make sure you have an example in an appropriate csv-spec file in the `x-pack/plugin/esql/qa/testFixtures/src/main/resources/` directory.
* Make sure the example has a tag that is unique in that file, and matches the intent of the test, or the docs reason for including that test.
* If you only want to show the query, and no results, then do not tag the results table,
  otherwise tag the results table with a tag that has the same name as the query tag, but with the suffix `-result`.
* Create a file with the name of the tag in a subdirectory with the name of the csv-spec file
  in the `_snippets/commands/examples` directory. While you could add the content to that file, it is not necessary, merely that the file exists
* Run the test `CommandsDocsTests` in the `x-pack/plugin/esql` module to generate the content.

For example, we tag the following test in change_point.csv-spec:

```
example for docs
required_capability: change_point

// tag::changePointForDocs[]
ROW key=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]
| MV_EXPAND key
| EVAL value = CASE(key<13, 0, 42)
| CHANGE_POINT value ON key
| WHERE type IS NOT NULL
// end::changePointForDocs[]
;

// tag::changePointForDocs-result[]
key:integer | value:integer | type:keyword | pvalue:double
13          | 42            | step_change  | 0.0
// end::changePointForDocs-result[]
;
```

Then we create the file `_snippets/commands/examples/change_point.csv-spec/changePointForDocs.md` with the content:
```
This should be overwritten
```

Then we run the test `CommandsDocsTests` in the `x-pack/plugin/esql` module to generate the content.

Now the content of the changePointForDocs.md file should have been updated:

```
% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

\```esql
ROW key=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]
| MV_EXPAND key
| EVAL value = CASE(key<13, 0, 42)
| CHANGE_POINT value ON key
| WHERE type IS NOT NULL
\```

| key:integer | value:integer | type:keyword | pvalue:double |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | 42 | step_change | 0.0 |
```

Finally include this file in the `CHANGE_POINT` command file `_snippets/commands/layout/change_point.md`:

```
**Examples**

The following example shows the detection of a step change:

:::{include} ../examples/change_point.csv-spec/changePointForDocs.md
:::
```

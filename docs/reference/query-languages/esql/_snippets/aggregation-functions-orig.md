## {{esql}} aggregate functions [esql-agg-functions]


The [`STATS`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-stats-by) command supports these aggregate functions:

:::{include} lists/aggregation-functions.md
:::

## `AVG` [esql-avg]

**Syntax**

:::{image} ../../../../images/avg.svg
:alt: Embedded
:class: text-center
:::

**Parameters**

true
**Description**

The average of a numeric field.

**Supported types**

| number | result |
| --- | --- |
| double | double |
| integer | double |
| long | double |

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS AVG(height)
```

| AVG(height):double |
| --- |
| 1.7682 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the average over a multivalued column, first use `MV_AVG` to average the multiple values per row, and use the result with the `AVG` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS avg_salary_change = ROUND(AVG(MV_AVG(salary_change)), 10)
```

| avg_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| 1.3904535865 |


## `COUNT` [esql-count]

**Syntax**

:::{image} ../../../../images/count.svg
:alt: Embedded
:class: text-center
:::

**Parameters**

`field`
:   Expression that outputs values to be counted. If omitted, equivalent to `COUNT(*)` (the number of rows).

**Description**

Returns the total number (count) of input values.

**Supported types**

| field | result |
| --- | --- |
| boolean | long |
| cartesian_point | long |
| date | long |
| double | long |
| geo_point | long |
| integer | long |
| ip | long |
| keyword | long |
| long | long |
| text | long |
| unsigned_long | long |
| version | long |

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS COUNT(height)
```

| COUNT(height):long |
| --- |
| 100 |

To count the number of rows, use `COUNT()` or `COUNT(*)`

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS count = COUNT(*) BY languages
| SORT languages DESC
```

| count:long | languages:integer |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | null |
| 21 | 5 |
| 18 | 4 |
| 17 | 3 |
| 19 | 2 |
| 15 | 1 |

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into multiple values using the `SPLIT` function and counts the values

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS word_count = COUNT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

| word_count:long |
| --- |
| 6 |

To count the number of times an expression returns `TRUE` use a [`WHERE`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-where) command to remove rows that shouldn’t be included

```esql
ROW n=1
| WHERE n < 0
| STATS COUNT(n)
```

| COUNT(n):long |
| --- |
| 0 |

To count the same stream of data based on two different expressions use the pattern `COUNT(<expression> OR NULL)`. This builds on the three-valued logic ({{wikipedia}}/Three-valued_logic[3VL]) of the language: `TRUE OR NULL` is `TRUE`, but `FALSE OR NULL` is `NULL`, plus the way COUNT handles `NULL`s: `COUNT(TRUE)` and `COUNT(FALSE)` are both 1, but `COUNT(NULL)` is 0.

```esql
ROW n=1
| STATS COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL), COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL)
```

| COUNT(n > 0 OR NULL):long | COUNT(n < 0 OR NULL):long |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 |

| text | unsigned_long | long |
| text |  | long |
| version | integer | long |
| version | long | long |
| version | unsigned_long | long |
| version |  | long |

**Examples**

```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1)
```

| COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0):long | COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1):long |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 8 |

With the optional second parameter to configure the precision threshold

```esql
FROM hosts
| STATS COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0, 80000), COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1, 5)
```

| COUNT_DISTINCT(ip0, 80000):long | COUNT_DISTINCT(ip1, 5):long |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 9 |

The expression can use inline functions. This example splits a string into multiple values using the `SPLIT` function and counts the unique values

```esql
ROW words="foo;bar;baz;qux;quux;foo"
| STATS distinct_word_count = COUNT_DISTINCT(SPLIT(words, ";"))
```

| distinct_word_count:long |
| --- |
| 5 |


### Counts are approximate [esql-agg-count-distinct-approximate]

Computing exact counts requires loading values into a set and returning its size. This doesn’t scale when working on high-cardinality sets and/or large values as the required memory usage and the need to communicate those per-shard sets between nodes would utilize too many resources of the cluster.

This `COUNT_DISTINCT` function is based on the [HyperLogLog++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) algorithm, which counts based on the hashes of the values with some interesting properties:

* configurable precision, which decides on how to trade memory for accuracy,
* excellent accuracy on low-cardinality sets,
* fixed memory usage: no matter if there are tens or billions of unique values, memory usage only depends on the configured precision.

For a precision threshold of `c`, the implementation that we are using requires about `c * 8` bytes.

The following chart shows how the error varies before and after the threshold:

![cardinality error](../../../../images/cardinality_error.png "")

For all 3 thresholds, counts have been accurate up to the configured threshold. Although not guaranteed, this is likely to be the case. Accuracy in practice depends on the dataset in question. In general, most datasets show consistently good accuracy. Also note that even with a threshold as low as 100, the error remains very low (1-6% as seen in the above graph) even when counting millions of items.

The HyperLogLog++ algorithm depends on the leading zeros of hashed values, the exact distributions of hashes in a dataset can affect the accuracy of the cardinality.

The `COUNT_DISTINCT` function takes an optional second parameter to configure the precision threshold. The precision_threshold options allows to trade memory for accuracy, and defines a unique count below which counts are expected to be close to accurate. Above this value, counts might become a bit more fuzzy. The maximum supported value is 40000, thresholds above this number will have the same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is `3000`.


## `MAX` [esql-max]

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees

## `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` [esql-median_absolute_deviation]

**Syntax**

:::{image} ../../../../images/median_absolute_deviation.svg
:alt: Embedded
:class: text-center
:::

**Parameters**

true
**Description**

Returns the median absolute deviation, a measure of variability. It is a robust statistic, meaning that it is useful for describing data that may have outliers, or may not be normally distributed. For such data it can be more descriptive than standard deviation.  It is calculated as the median of each data point’s deviation from the median of the entire sample. That is, for a random variable `X`, the median absolute deviation is `median(|median(X) - X|)`.

::::{note}
Like [`PERCENTILE`](../esql-functions-operators.md#esql-percentile), `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` is [usually approximate](../esql-functions-operators.md#esql-percentile-approximate).

```

| MEDIAN(salary):double | MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(salary):double |
| --- | --- |
| 47003 | 10096.5 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the median absolute deviation of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use `MV_MAX` to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the `MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS m_a_d_max_salary_change = MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| m_a_d_max_salary_change:double |

```

| MIN(languages):integer |
| --- |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the minimum over an average of a multivalued column, use `MV_AVG` to first average the multiple values per row, and use the result with the `MIN` function

```esql

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate a percentile of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use `MV_MAX` to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the `PERCENTILE` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS p80_max_salary_change = PERCENTILE(MV_MAX(salary_change), 80)
```

| p80_max_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| 12.132 |


### `PERCENTILE` is (usually) approximate [esql-percentile-approximate]

There are many different algorithms to calculate percentiles. The naive implementation simply stores all the values in a sorted array. To find the 50th percentile, you simply find the value that is at `my_array[count(my_array) * 0.5]`.

Clearly, the naive implementation does not scale — the sorted array grows linearly with the number of values in your dataset. To calculate percentiles across potentially billions of values in an Elasticsearch cluster, *approximate* percentiles are calculated.

The algorithm used by the `percentile` metric is called TDigest (introduced by Ted Dunning in [Computing Accurate Quantiles using T-Digests](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf)).

When using this metric, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

* Accuracy is proportional to `q(1-q)`. This means that extreme percentiles (e.g. 99%) are more accurate than less extreme percentiles, such as the median
* For small sets of values, percentiles are highly accurate (and potentially 100% accurate if the data is small enough).
* As the quantity of values in a bucket grows, the algorithm begins to approximate the percentiles. It is effectively trading accuracy for memory savings. The exact level of inaccuracy is difficult to generalize, since it depends on your data distribution and volume of data being aggregated

The following chart shows the relative error on a uniform distribution depending on the number of collected values and the requested percentile:

![percentiles error](../../../../images/percentiles_error.png "")

It shows how precision is better for extreme percentiles. The reason why error diminishes for large number of values is that the law of large numbers makes the distribution of values more and more uniform and the t-digest tree can do a better job at summarizing it. It would not be the case on more skewed distributions.

`PERCENTILE` is also [non-deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm). This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.

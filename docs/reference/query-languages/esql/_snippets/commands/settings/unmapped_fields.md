```{applies_to}

```
Defines how unmapped fields are treated. Possible values are: "FAIL" (default) - fails the query if unmapped fields are present; "NULLIFY" - treats unmapped fields as null values. 

**Type**: `keyword`

**Example**

Make the field null if it is unmapped.

```esql
SET unmapped_fields="nullify";
FROM employees
| KEEP emp_*, foo
| SORT emp_no
| LIMIT 1
```

| emp_no:integer | foo:null |
| --- | --- |
| 10001 | null |

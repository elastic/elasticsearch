`unmapped_fields` {applies_to}`serverless: preview` {applies_to}`stack: preview`
:   Defines how unmapped fields are treated. Possible values are: "FAIL" (default) - fails the query if unmapped fields are present; "NULLIFY" - treats unmapped fields as null values.  **Type**: `keyword`.
    
    **Example**

    Make the field null if it is unmapped.

    ```esql
    SET unmapped_fields="nullify";
    FROM employees
    | KEEP foo
    | LIMIT 3
    ```
    
   | foo:null |
   | --- |
   | null |
   | null |
   | null |

This can use a significant amount of memory and ES|QL doesn’t yet
grow aggregations beyond the memory available. This function will
continue to work until it is used to collect more values than can
fit into memory, in which case it will fail the query with a
[Circuit Breaker Error](docs-content://troubleshoot/elasticsearch/circuit-breaker-errors.md).
This is especially the case when grouping on a field with a large
number of unique values, and even more so if the search field
has multi-values of high cardinality.

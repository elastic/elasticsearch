::::{note}
Use [`TOP`](/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/aggregation-functions.md#esql-top) if you need to keep repeated values.

::::{warning}
This can use a significant amount of memory and ES|QL doesnâ€™t yet
grow aggregations beyond memory. So this aggregation will work until
it is used to collect more values than can fit into memory. Once it
collects too many values it will fail the query with
a [Circuit Breaker Error](docs-content://troubleshoot/elasticsearch/circuit-breaker-errors.md).

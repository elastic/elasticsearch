**Description**

Use `CHUNK` to split a text field into smaller chunks.

Chunk can be used on fields from the text famiy like [text](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/text.md) and [semantic_text](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text.md).
    Chunk will split a text field into smaller chunks, using a sentence-based chunking strategy.
    The number of chunks returned, and the length of the sentences used to create the chunks can be specified.

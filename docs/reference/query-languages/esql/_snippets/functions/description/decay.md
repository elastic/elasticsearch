**Description**

Calculates a relevance score that decays based on the distance of a numeric, spatial or date type value from a target origin, using configurable decay functions.

`DECAY` calculates a score between 0 and 1 based on how far a field value is from a specified origin point (called distance).
The distance can be a numeric distance, spatial distance or temporal distance depending on the specific data type.

`DECAY` can use [function named parameters](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax.md#esql-function-named-params) to specify additional `options`
for the decay function.

For spatial queries, scale and offset for geo points use distance units (e.g., "10km", "5mi"),
while cartesian points use numeric values. For date queries, scale and offset use time_duration values.
For numeric queries you also use numeric values.

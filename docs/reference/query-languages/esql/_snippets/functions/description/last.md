**Description**

This function calculates the latest occurrence of the search field (the first parameter), where sorting order is determined by the sort field (the second parameter). Both fields support null, single-valued, and multi-valued input. If the latest sort field value appears in multiple documents, this function is allowed to return any corresponding search field value. Null values of the sort field always sort last.

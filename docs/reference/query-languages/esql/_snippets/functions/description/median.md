**Description**

The value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50% [`PERCENTILE`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-percentile).

::::{note}
Like [`PERCENTILE`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-percentile), `MEDIAN` is [usually approximate](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-percentile-approximate).

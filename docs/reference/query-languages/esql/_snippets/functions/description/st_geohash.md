**Description**

Calculates the `geohash` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision. The result is long encoded. Use [TO_STRING](#esql-to_string) to convert the result to a string, [TO_LONG](#esql-to_long) to convert it to a `long`, or [TO_GEOSHAPE](#esql-to_geoshape) to calculate the `geo_shape` bounding geometry.  These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query.md) and the [`geohash_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.md).

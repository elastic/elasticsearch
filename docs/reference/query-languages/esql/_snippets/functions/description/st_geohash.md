**Description**

Calculates the `geohash` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision. The result is long encoded. Use [ST_GEOHASH_TO_STRING](#esql-st_geohash_to_string) to convert the result to a string.  These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query.md) and the [`geohash_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation.md).

**Description**

Calculates the `geohex`, the H3 cell-id, of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision. The result is long encoded. Use [ST_GEOHEX_TO_STRING](#esql-st_geohex_to_string) to convert the result to a string. Or use [ST_GEOHEX_TO_GEOSHAPE](#esql-st_geohex_to_geoshape) to convert either the long or string `geohex` to a POLYGON geo_shape.  These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query) and the [`geohex_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation).

**Description**

Calculates the `geohex`, the H3 cell-id, of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision. The result is long encoded. Use [TO_STRING](#esql-to_string) to convert the result to a string, [TO_LONG](#esql-to_long) to convert it to a `long`, or [TO_GEOSHAPE](esql-to_geoshape.md) to calculate the `geo_shape` bounding geometry.  These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query.md) and the [`geohex_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation.md).

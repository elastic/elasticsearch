**Description**

Calculates the `geotile` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision. The result is long encoded. Use [ST_GEOTILE_TO_STRING](#esql-st_geotile_to_string) to convert the result to a string.  These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query.md) and the [`geotile_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation.md).

**Description**

Converts an input value to an integer value. If the input parameter is of a date type, its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), converted to integer. Boolean `true` will be converted to integer `1`, `false` to `0`.

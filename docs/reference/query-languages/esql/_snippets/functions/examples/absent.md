**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE emp_no == 10020
| STATS is_absent = ABSENT(languages)
```

| is_absent:boolean |
| --- |
| true |

To check for the absence inside a group use `ABSENT()` and `BY` clauses

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_absent = ABSENT(salary) BY languages
```

| is_absent:boolean | languages:integer |
| --- | --- |
| false | 1 |
| false | 2 |
| false | 3 |
| false | 4 |
| false | 5 |
| false | null |

To check for the absence and return 1 when it's true and 0 when it's false you can use to_integer()

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE emp_no == 10020
| STATS is_absent = TO_INTEGER(ABSENT(languages))
```

| is_absent:integer |
| --- |
| 1 |

**Examples**

```esql
ROW date = DATE_PARSE("yyyy-MM-dd", "2022-05-06")
| EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", date)
```

| date:date | year:long |
| --- | --- |
| 2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z | 2022 |

Find all events that occurred outside of business hours (before 9 AM or after 5PM), on any given date:

```esql
FROM sample_data
| WHERE DATE_EXTRACT("hour_of_day", @timestamp) < 9 AND DATE_EXTRACT("hour_of_day", @timestamp) >= 17
```

| @timestamp:date | client_ip:ip | event_duration:long | message:keyword |

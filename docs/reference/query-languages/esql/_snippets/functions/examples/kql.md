**Examples**

Use KQL to filter by a specific field value

```esql
FROM books
| WHERE KQL("author: Faulkner")
```

| book_no:keyword | author:text |
| --- | --- |
| 2378 | [Carol Faulkner, Holly Byers Ochoa, Lucretia Mott] |
| 2713 | William Faulkner |
| 2847 | Colleen Faulkner |
| 2883 | William Faulkner |
| 3293 | Danny Faulkner |

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.3.0
```

Use KQL with additional options for case-insensitive matching and custom settings

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE KQL("mary", {"case_insensitive": true, "default_field": "first_name", "boost": 1.5})
```

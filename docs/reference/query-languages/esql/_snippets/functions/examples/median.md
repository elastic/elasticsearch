% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```

| MEDIAN(salary):double | PERCENTILE(salary, 50):double |
| --- | --- |
| 47003 | 47003 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the median of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use `MV_MAX` to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the `MEDIAN` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS median_max_salary_change = MEDIAN(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| median_max_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| 7.69 |

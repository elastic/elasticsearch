**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS MIN(languages)
```

| MIN(languages):integer |
| --- |
| 1 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the minimum over an average of a multivalued column, use `MV_AVG` to first average the multiple values per row, and use the result with the `MIN` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS min_avg_salary_change = MIN(MV_AVG(salary_change))
```

| min_avg_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| -8.46 |

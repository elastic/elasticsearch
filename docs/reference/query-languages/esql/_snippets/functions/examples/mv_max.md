% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL max_a = MV_MAX(a)
```

| a:integer | max_a:integer |
| --- | --- |
| [3, 5, 1] | 5 |

It can be used by any column type, including `keyword` columns. In that case it picks the last string, comparing their utf-8 representation byte by byte:

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "zoo", "bar"]
| EVAL max_a = MV_MAX(a)
```

| a:keyword | max_a:keyword |
| --- | --- |
| ["foo", "zoo", "bar"] | "zoo" |

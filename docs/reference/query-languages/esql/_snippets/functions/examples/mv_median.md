% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
ROW a=[3, 5, 1]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```

| a:integer | median_a:integer |
| --- | --- |
| [3, 5, 1] | 3 |

If the row has an even number of values for a column, the result will be the average of the middle two entries. If the column is not floating point, the average rounds **down**:

```esql
ROW a=[3, 7, 1, 6]
| EVAL median_a = MV_MEDIAN(a)
```

| a:integer | median_a:integer |
| --- | --- |
| [3, 7, 1, 6] | 4 |

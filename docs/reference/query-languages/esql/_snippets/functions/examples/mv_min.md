% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do no edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
ROW a=[2, 1]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

| a:integer | min_a:integer |
| --- | --- |
| [2, 1] | 1 |

It can be used by any column type, including `keyword` columns. In that case, it picks the first string, comparing their utf-8 representation byte by byte:

```esql
ROW a=["foo", "bar"]
| EVAL min_a = MV_MIN(a)
```

| a:keyword | min_a:keyword |
| --- | --- |
| ["foo", "bar"] | "bar" |

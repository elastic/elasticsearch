**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS p0 = PERCENTILE(salary,  0)
     , p50 = PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
     , p99 = PERCENTILE(salary, 99)
```

| p0:double | p50:double | p99:double |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25324 | 47003 | 74970.29 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate a percentile of the maximum values of a multivalued column, first use `MV_MAX` to get the maximum value per row, and use the result with the `PERCENTILE` function

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS p80_max_salary_change = PERCENTILE(MV_MAX(salary_change), 80)
```

| p80_max_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| 12.132 |

**Examples**

```esql
ROW base = 2.0, exponent = 2
| EVAL result = POW(base, exponent)
```

| base:double | exponent:integer | result:double |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.0 | 2 | 4.0 |

The exponent can be a fraction, which is similar to performing a root.
For example, the exponent of `0.5` will give the square root of the base:

```esql
ROW base = 4, exponent = 0.5
| EVAL s = POW(base, exponent)
```

| base:integer | exponent:double | s:double |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 0.5 | 2.0 |

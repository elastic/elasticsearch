% This is generated by ESQL's AbstractFunctionTestCase. Do not edit it. See ../README.md for how to regenerate it.

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(languages)
```

| is_present:boolean |
| --- |
| true |

To check for the presence inside a group use `PRESENT()` and `BY` clauses

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS is_present = PRESENT(salary) BY languages
```

| is_present:boolean | languages:integer |
| --- | --- |
| true | 1 |
| true | 2 |
| true | 3 |
| true | 4 |
| true | 5 |
| true | null |

To check for the presence and return 1 when it's true and 0 when it's false

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE emp_no == 10020
| STATS is_present = TO_INTEGER(PRESENT(languages))
```

| is_present:integer |
| --- |
| 0 |

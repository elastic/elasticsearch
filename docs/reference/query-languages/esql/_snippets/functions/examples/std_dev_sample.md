**Examples**

```esql
null
```

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the sample standard deviation of each employeeâ€™s maximum salary changes, first use `MV_MAX` on each row, and then use `STD_DEV_SAMPLE` on the result

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS stddev_sample_salary_change = STD_DEV_SAMPLE(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

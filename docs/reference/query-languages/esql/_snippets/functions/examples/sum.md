**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS SUM(languages)
```

| SUM(languages):long |
| --- |
| 281 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the sum of each employeeâ€™s maximum salary changes, apply the `MV_MAX` function to each row and then sum the results

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS total_salary_changes = SUM(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| total_salary_changes:double |
| --- |
| 446.75 |

**Example**

Provide a bucket size as an argument.

```esql
FROM sample_data
| STATS min = MAX(@timestamp), max = MAX(@timestamp) BY bucket = TBUCKET(30 minutes)
| SORT min
```

| min:date | max:date | bucket:date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z | 2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z | 2023-10-23T12:00:00.000Z |
| 2023-10-23T13:55:01.543Z | 2023-10-23T13:55:01.543Z | 2023-10-23T13:30:00.000Z |


::::{note}
When providing the bucket size, it must be a time duration or date period.
Also the reference is epoch, which starts at `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`.

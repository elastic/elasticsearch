**Example**

```esql
ROW long = [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000]
| EVAL int = TO_INTEGER(long)
```

| long:long | int:integer |
| --- | --- |
| [5013792, 2147483647, 501379200000] | [5013792, 2147483647] |


Note that in this example, the last value of the multi-valued field cannot be converted as an integer.
When this happens, the result is a `null` value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:61: evaluation of [TO_INTEGER(long)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

`"org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.core.InvalidArgumentException: [501379200000] out of [integer] range"`

**Example**

```esql
ROW str1 = "1.1.1.1", str2 = "foo"
| EVAL ip1 = TO_IP(str1), ip2 = TO_IP(str2)
| WHERE CIDR_MATCH(ip1, "1.0.0.0/8")
```

| str1:keyword | str2:keyword | ip1:ip | ip2:ip |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1.1 | foo | 1.1.1.1 | null |


Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isnâ€™t possible.
When this happens, the result is a `null` value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:68: evaluation of [TO_IP(str2)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

`"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'foo' is not an IP string literal."`

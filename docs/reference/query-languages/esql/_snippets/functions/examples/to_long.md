**Example**

```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_LONG(str2), long3 = TO_LONG(str3)
```

| str1:keyword | str2:keyword | str3:keyword | long1:long | long2:long | long3:long |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2147483648 | 2147483648.2 | foo | 2147483648 | 2147483648 | null |


Note that in this example, the last conversion of the string isnâ€™t possible.
When this happens, the result is a `null` value. In this case a _Warning_ header is added to the response.
The header will provide information on the source of the failure:

`"Line 1:113: evaluation of [TO_LONG(str3)] failed, treating result as null. Only first 20 failures recorded."`

A following header will contain the failure reason and the offending value:

`"java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "foo""`

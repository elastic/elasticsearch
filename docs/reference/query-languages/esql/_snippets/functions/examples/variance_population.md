**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS VARIANCE_POPULATION(height)
```

| VARIANCE_POPULATION(height):double |
| --- |
| 0.042588759999999996 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the population variance of each employeeâ€™s maximum salary changes, first use `MV_MAX` on each row, and then use `VARIANCE_POPULATION` on the result

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS variance_salary_change = VARIANCE_POPULATION(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| variance_salary_change:double |
| --- |

**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS VARIANCE_SAMPLE(height)
```

| VARIANCE_SAMPLE(height):double |
| --- |
| 0.04301894949494949 |

The expression can use inline functions. For example, to calculate the sample variance of each employeeâ€™s maximum salary changes, first use `MV_MAX` on each row, and then use `VARIANCE_SAMPLE` on the result

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS variance_sample_salary_change = VARIANCE_SAMPLE(MV_MAX(salary_change))
```

| variance_sample_salary_change:double |
| --- |
| 47.88314839337879 |

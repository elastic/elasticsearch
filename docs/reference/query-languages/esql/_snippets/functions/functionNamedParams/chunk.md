**Supported function named parameters**

`separator_group`
:   (keyword) Sets a predefined lists of separators based on the selected text type. Values may be `markdown` or `plaintext`.
Only applicable to the `recursive` chunking strategy. When using the `recursive` chunking strategy one of
`separators` or `separator_group` must be specified.


`overlap`
:   (integer) The number of overlapping words for chunks. It is applicable only to a `word` chunking strategy.
This value cannot be higher than half the `max_chunk_size` value.


`sentence_overlap`
:   (integer) The number of overlapping sentences for chunks. It is applicable only for a `sentence` chunking strategy.
It can be either `1` or `0`.


`strategy`
:   (keyword) The chunking strategy to use. Default value is `sentence`.

`max_chunk_size`
:   (integer) The maximum size of a chunk in words. This value cannot be lower than `20` (for `sentence` strategy)
or `10` (for `word` or `recursive` strategies). This model should not exceed the window size for any
associated models using the output of this function.


`separators`
:   (keyword) A list of strings used as possible split points when chunking text. Each string can be a plain string or a
regular expression (regex) pattern. The system tries each separator in order to split the text, starting from
the first item in the list. After splitting, it attempts to recombine smaller pieces into larger chunks that stay
within the `max_chunk_size` limit, to reduce the total number of chunks generated. Only applicable to the
`recursive` chunking strategy. When using the `recursive` chunking strategy one of `separators` or `separator_group`
must be specified.

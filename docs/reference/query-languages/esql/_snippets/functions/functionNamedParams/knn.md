**Supported function named parameters**

`num_candidates`
:   (integer) The number of nearest neighbor candidates to consider per shard while doing knn search. Cannot exceed 10,000. Increasing num_candidates tends to improve the accuracy of the final results. Defaults to 1.5 * k

`boost`
:   (float) Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of the query.Defaults to 1.0.

`k`
:   (integer) The number of nearest neighbors to return from each shard. Elasticsearch collects k results from each shard, then merges them to find the global top results. This value must be less than or equal to num_candidates. Defaults to 10.

`rescore_oversample`
:   (double) Applies the specified oversampling for rescoring quantized vectors. See [oversampling and rescoring quantized vectors](docs-content://solutions/search/vector/knn.md#dense-vector-knn-search-rescoring) for details.

`similarity`
:   (double) The minimum similarity required for a document to be considered a match. The similarity value calculated relates to the raw similarity used, not the document score.

| default_operator | [keyword] | Default boolean logic used to interpret text in the query string if no operators are specified. |
| analyzer | [keyword] | Analyzer used to convert the text in the query value into token. Defaults to the index-time analyzer mapped for the default_field. |
| fuzzy_max_expansions | [integer] | Maximum number of terms to which the query expands for fuzzy matching. Defaults to 50. |
| quote_analyzer | [keyword] | Analyzer used to convert quoted text in the query string into tokens. Defaults to the search_quote_analyzer mapped for the default_field. |
| allow_wildcard | [boolean] | If true, the query attempts to analyze wildcard terms in the query string. Defaults to false.  |
| boost | [float] | Floating point number used to decrease or increase the relevance scores of the query. |

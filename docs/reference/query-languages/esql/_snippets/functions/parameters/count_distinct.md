**Parameters**

`field`
:   Column or literal for which to count the number of distinct values.

`precision`
:   Precision threshold. Refer to [`AGG-COUNT-DISTINCT-APPROXIMATE`](/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/aggregation-functions.md#esql-agg-count-distinct-approximate). The maximum supported value is 40000. Thresholds above this number will have the same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is 3000.

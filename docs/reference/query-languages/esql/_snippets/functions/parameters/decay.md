**Parameters**

`value`
:   Value to calculate decayed value for.

`origin`
:   Central point from which the distances are calculated.

`scale`
:   Distance from the origin where the function returns the decay value.

`offset`
:   Distance from the origin where no decay occurs.

`decay`
:   Multiplier value returned at the scale distance from the origin.

`type`
:   Function to use: linear, exponential or gaussian decay.

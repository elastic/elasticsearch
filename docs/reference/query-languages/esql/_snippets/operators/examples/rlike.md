**Examples**

```esql
FROM employees
| WHERE first_name RLIKE """.leja.*"""
| KEEP first_name, last_name
```

| first_name:keyword | last_name:keyword |
| --- | --- |

Matching special characters (eg. `.`, `*`, `(`…​) will require escaping. The escape character is backslash `\`. Since also backslash is a special character in string literals, it will require further escaping.

```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE "foo \\( bar"
```

To reduce the overhead of escaping, we suggest using triple quotes strings `"""`

```esql
ROW message = "foo ( bar"
| WHERE message RLIKE """foo \( bar"""
```

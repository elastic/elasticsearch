## `LIKE` [esql-like]

Use `LIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using wildcards. `LIKE` usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.

The following wildcard characters are supported:

* `*` matches zero or more characters.
* `?` matches one character.

The match operator performs a [match query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query.md) on the specified field. Returns true if the provided query matches the row.

The match operator is equivalent to the [match function](../../../esql-functions-operators.md#esql-match).

For using the function syntax, or adding [match query parameters](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query.md#match-field-params), you can use the [match function](../../../esql-functions-operators.md#esql-match).

## Inequality `!=` [esql-not_equals]

:::{image} ../../../images/operators/not_equals.svg
:alt: Embedded
:class: text-center
:::

Check if two fields are unequal. If either field is [multivalued](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields.md) then the result is `null`.

::::{note}
This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an [`index`](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-index.md) and [`doc_values`](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values.md).

## `RLIKE` [esql-rlike]

Use `RLIKE` to filter data based on string patterns using using [regular expressions](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/regexp-syntax.md). `RLIKE` usually acts on a field placed on the left-hand side of the operator, but it can also act on a constant (literal) expression. The right-hand side of the operator represents the pattern.

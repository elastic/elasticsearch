# {{esql}} commands [esql-commands]

{{esql}} commands come in two flavors: source commands and processing commands:

- An {{esql}} query must start with a [source command](./commands/source-commands.md).
- Use [processing commands](./commands/processing-commands.md) to modify an input table by adding, removing, or transforming rows and columns.

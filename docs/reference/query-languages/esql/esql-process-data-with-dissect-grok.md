# Data processing with DISSECT and GROK [esql-process-data-with-dissect-and-grok]


Your data may contain unstructured strings that you want to structure. This makes it easier to analyze the data. For example, log messages may contain IP addresses that you want to extract so you can find the most active IP addresses.

:::{image} ../../../images/unstructured-data.png
:alt: unstructured data
:::

{{es}} can structure your data at index time or query time. At index time, you can use the [Dissect](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/dissect-processor.md) and [Grok](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/grok-processor.md) ingest processors, or the {{ls}} [Dissect](logstash://reference/plugins-filters-dissect.md) and [Grok](logstash://reference/plugins-filters-grok.md) filters. At query time, you can use the {{esql}} [`DISSECT`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-dissect) and [`GROK`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-grok) commands.

## `DISSECT` or `GROK`? Or both? [esql-grok-or-dissect]

`DISSECT` works by breaking up a string using a delimiter-based pattern. `GROK` works similarly, but uses regular expressions. This makes `GROK` more powerful, but generally also slower. `DISSECT` works well when data is reliably repeated. `GROK` is a better choice when you really need the power of regular expressions, for example when the structure of your text varies from row to row.

You can use both `DISSECT` and `GROK` for hybrid use cases. For example when a section of the line is reliably repeated, but the entire line is not. `DISSECT` can deconstruct the section of the line that is repeated. `GROK` can process the remaining field values using regular expressions.


## Process data with `DISSECT` [esql-process-data-with-dissect]

The [`DISSECT`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-dissect) processing command matches a string against a delimiter-based pattern, and extracts the specified keys as columns.

For example, the following pattern:

```txt
%{clientip} [%{@timestamp}] %{status}
```

matches a log line of this format:

```txt
1.2.3.4 [2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z] Connected
```

and results in adding the following columns to the input table:

| clientip:keyword | @timestamp:keyword | status:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2.3.4 | 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z | Connected |

### Dissect patterns [esql-dissect-patterns]

A dissect pattern is defined by the parts of the string that will be discarded. In the previous example, the first part to be discarded is a single space. Dissect finds this space, then assigns the value of `clientip` everything up until that space. Next, dissect matches the `[` and then `]` and then assigns `@timestamp` to everything in-between `[` and `]`. Paying special attention to the parts of the string to discard will help build successful dissect patterns.

An empty key (`%{}`) or [named skip key](#esql-named-skip-key) can be used to match values, but exclude the value from the output.

All matched values are output as keyword string data types. Use the [Type conversion functions](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-type-conversion-functions) to convert to another data type.

Dissect also supports [key modifiers](#esql-dissect-key-modifiers) that can change dissect’s default behavior. For example, you can instruct dissect to ignore certain fields, append fields, skip over padding, etc.


### Terminology [esql-dissect-terminology]

dissect pattern
:   the set of fields and delimiters describing the textual format. Also known as a dissection. The dissection is described using a set of `%{}` sections: `%{{a}} - %{{b}} - %{{c}}`

field
:   the text from `%{` to `}` inclusive.

delimiter
:   the text between `}` and the next `%{` characters. Any set of characters other than `%{`, `'not }'`, or `}` is a delimiter.

key
:   the text between the `%{` and `}`, exclusive of the `?`, `+`, `&` prefixes and the ordinal suffix.

Examples:

* `%{?aaa}` - the key is `aaa`
* `%{+bbb/3}` - the key is `bbb`
* `%{&ccc}` - the key is `ccc`



### Examples [esql-dissect-examples]

The following example parses a string that contains a timestamp, some text, and an IP address:

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z - some text - 127.0.0.1"
| DISSECT a """%{date} - %{msg} - %{ip}"""
| KEEP date, msg, ip
```

| date:keyword | msg:keyword | ip:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z | some text | 127.0.0.1 |

By default, `DISSECT` outputs keyword string columns. To convert to another type, use [Type conversion functions](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-type-conversion-functions):

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z - some text - 127.0.0.1"
| DISSECT a """%{date} - %{msg} - %{ip}"""
| KEEP date, msg, ip
| EVAL date = TO_DATETIME(date)
```

| msg:keyword | ip:keyword | date:date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| some text | 127.0.0.1 | 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z |


### Dissect key modifiers [esql-dissect-key-modifiers]

Key modifiers can change the default behavior for dissection. Key modifiers may be found on the left or right of the `%{{keyname}}` always inside the `%{` and `}`. For example `%{+keyname ->}` has the append and right padding modifiers.

$$$esql-dissect-key-modifiers-table$$$

| Modifier | Name | Position | Example | Description | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `->` | Skip right padding | (far) right | `%{keyname1->}` | Skips any repeated characters to the right | [link](#esql-dissect-modifier-skip-right-padding) |
| `+` | Append | left | `%{+keyname} %{+keyname}` | Appends two or more fields together | [link](#esql-append-modifier) |
| `+` with `/n` | Append with order | left and right | `%{+keyname/2} %{+keyname/1}` | Appends two or more fields together in the order specified | [link](#esql-append-order-modifier) |
| `?` | Named skip key | left | `%{?ignoreme}` | Skips the matched value in the output. Same behavior as `%{}` | [link](#esql-named-skip-key) |

#### Right padding modifier (`->`) [esql-dissect-modifier-skip-right-padding]

The algorithm that performs the dissection is very strict in that it requires all characters in the pattern to match the source string. For example, the pattern `%{{fookey}} %{{barkey}}` (1 space), will match the string "foo bar" (1 space), but will not match the string "foo  bar" (2 spaces) since the pattern has only 1 space and the source string has 2 spaces.

The right padding modifier helps with this case. Adding the right padding modifier to the pattern `%{fookey->} %{{barkey}}`, It will now will match "foo bar" (1 space) and "foo  bar" (2 spaces) and even "foo          bar" (10 spaces).

Use the right padding modifier to allow for repetition of the characters after a `%{keyname->}`.

The right padding modifier may be placed on any key with any other modifiers. It should always be the furthest right modifier. For example: `%{+keyname/1->}` and `%{->}`

For example:

```esql
ROW message="1998-08-10T17:15:42          WARN"
| DISSECT message """%{ts->} %{level}"""
```

| message:keyword | ts:keyword | level:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1998-08-10T17:15:42          WARN | 1998-08-10T17:15:42 | WARN |

The right padding modifier may be used with an empty key to help skip unwanted data. For example, the same input string, but wrapped with brackets requires the use of an empty right padded key to achieve the same result.

For example:

```esql
ROW message="[1998-08-10T17:15:42]          [WARN]"
| DISSECT message """[%{ts}]%{->}[%{level}]"""
```

| message:keyword | ts:keyword | level:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ["[1998-08-10T17:15:42]          [WARN]"] | 1998-08-10T17:15:42 | WARN |


#### Append modifier (`+`) [esql-append-modifier]

Dissect supports appending two or more results together for the output. Values are appended left to right. An append separator can be specified. In this example the append_separator is defined as a space.

```esql
ROW message="john jacob jingleheimer schmidt"
| DISSECT message """%{+name} %{+name} %{+name} %{+name}""" APPEND_SEPARATOR=" "
```

| message:keyword | name:keyword |
| --- | --- |
| john jacob jingleheimer schmidt | john jacob jingleheimer schmidt |


#### Append with order modifier (`+` and `/n`) [esql-append-order-modifier]

Dissect supports appending two or more results together for the output. Values are appended based on the order defined (`/n`). An append separator can be specified. In this example the append_separator is defined as a comma.

```esql
ROW message="john jacob jingleheimer schmidt"
| DISSECT message """%{+name/2} %{+name/4} %{+name/3} %{+name/1}""" APPEND_SEPARATOR=","
```

| message:keyword | name:keyword |
| --- | --- |
| john jacob jingleheimer schmidt | schmidt,john,jingleheimer,jacob |


#### Named skip key (`?`) [esql-named-skip-key]

Dissect supports ignoring matches in the final result. This can be done with an empty key `%{}`, but for readability it may be desired to give that empty key a name.

This can be done with a named skip key using the `{?name}` syntax. In the following query, `ident` and `auth` are not added to the output table:

```esql
ROW message="1.2.3.4 - - 30/Apr/1998:22:00:52 +0000"
| DISSECT message """%{clientip} %{?ident} %{?auth} %{@timestamp}"""
```

| message:keyword | clientip:keyword | @timestamp:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2.3.4 - - 30/Apr/1998:22:00:52 +0000 | 1.2.3.4 | 30/Apr/1998:22:00:52 +0000 |



### Limitations [esql-dissect-limitations]

The `DISSECT` command does not support reference keys.



## Process data with `GROK` [esql-process-data-with-grok]

The [`GROK`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-commands.md#esql-grok) processing command matches a string against a pattern based on regular expressions, and extracts the specified keys as columns.

For example, the following pattern:

```txt
%{IP:ip} \[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:@timestamp}\] %{GREEDYDATA:status}
```

matches a log line of this format:

```txt
1.2.3.4 [2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z] Connected
```

Putting it together as an {{esql}} query:

```esql
ROW a = "1.2.3.4 [2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z] Connected"
| GROK a """%{IP:ip} \[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:@timestamp}\] %{GREEDYDATA:status}"""
```

`GROK` adds the following columns to the input table:

| @timestamp:keyword | ip:keyword | status:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z | 1.2.3.4 | Connected |

::::{note}
Special regex characters in grok patterns, like `[` and `]` need to be escaped with a `\`. For example, in the earlier pattern:

```txt
%{IP:ip} \[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:@timestamp}\] %{GREEDYDATA:status}
```

In {{esql}} queries, when using single quotes for strings, the backslash character itself is a special character that needs to be escaped with another `\`. For this example, the corresponding {{esql}} query becomes:

```esql
ROW a = "1.2.3.4 [2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z] Connected"
| GROK a "%{IP:ip} \\[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:@timestamp}\\] %{GREEDYDATA:status}"
```

For this reason, in general it is more convenient to use triple quotes `"""` for GROK patterns, that do not require escaping for backslash.

```esql
ROW a = "1.2.3.4 [2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z] Connected"
| GROK a """%{IP:ip} \[%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:@timestamp}\] %{GREEDYDATA:status}"""
```

::::


### Grok patterns [esql-grok-patterns]

The syntax for a grok pattern is `%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}`

The `SYNTAX` is the name of the pattern that matches your text. For example, `3.44` is matched by the `NUMBER` pattern and `55.3.244.1` is matched by the `IP` pattern. The syntax is how you match.

The `SEMANTIC` is the identifier you give to the piece of text being matched. For example, `3.44` could be the duration of an event, so you could call it simply `duration`. Further, a string `55.3.244.1` might identify the `client` making a request.

By default, matched values are output as keyword string data types. To convert a semantic’s data type, suffix it with the target data type. For example `%{NUMBER:num:int}`, which converts the `num` semantic from a string to an integer. Currently the only supported conversions are `int` and `float`. For other types, use the [Type conversion functions](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-type-conversion-functions).

For an overview of the available patterns, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch//blob/master/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns). You can also retrieve a list of all patterns using a [REST API](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/grok-processor.md#grok-processor-rest-get).


### Regular expressions [esql-grok-regex]

Grok is based on regular expressions. Any regular expressions are valid in grok as well. Grok uses the Oniguruma regular expression library. Refer to [the Oniguruma GitHub repository](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/blob/master/doc/RE) for the full supported regexp syntax.


### Custom patterns [esql-custom-patterns]

If grok doesn’t have a pattern you need, you can use the Oniguruma syntax for named capture which lets you match a piece of text and save it as a column:

```txt
(?<field_name>the pattern here)
```

For example, postfix logs have a `queue id` that is a 10 or 11-character hexadecimal value. This can be captured to a column named `queue_id` with:

```txt
(?<queue_id>[0-9A-F]{10,11})
```


### Examples [esql-grok-examples]

The following example parses a string that contains a timestamp, an IP address, an email address, and a number:

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
```

| date:keyword | ip:keyword | email:keyword | num:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z | 127.0.0.1 | `some.email@foo.com` | 42 |

By default, `GROK` outputs keyword string columns. `int` and `float` types can be converted by appending `:type` to the semantics in the pattern. For example `{NUMBER:num:int}`:

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num:int}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
```

| date:keyword | ip:keyword | email:keyword | num:integer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z | 127.0.0.1 | `some.email@foo.com` | 42 |

For other type conversions, use [Type conversion functions](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-type-conversion-functions):

```esql
ROW a = "2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z 127.0.0.1 some.email@foo.com 42"
| GROK a """%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:date} %{IP:ip} %{EMAILADDRESS:email} %{NUMBER:num:int}"""
| KEEP date, ip, email, num
| EVAL date = TO_DATETIME(date)
```

| ip:keyword | email:keyword | num:integer | date:date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 127.0.0.1 | `some.email@foo.com` | 42 | 2023-01-23T12:15:00.000Z |

If a field name is used more than once, `GROK` creates a multi-valued column:

```esql
FROM addresses
| KEEP city.name, zip_code
| GROK zip_code """%{WORD:zip_parts} %{WORD:zip_parts}"""
```

| city.name:keyword | zip_code:keyword | zip_parts:keyword |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Amsterdam | 1016 ED | ["1016", "ED"] |
| San Francisco | CA 94108 | ["CA", "94108"] |
| Tokyo | 100-7014 | null |


### Grok debugger [esql-grok-debugger]

To write and debug grok patterns, you can use the [Grok Debugger](docs-content://explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/grok-debugger.md). It provides a UI for testing patterns against sample data. Under the covers, it uses the same engine as the `GROK` command.


### Limitations [esql-grok-limitations]

The `GROK` command does not support configuring [custom patterns](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/grok-processor.md#custom-patterns), or [multiple patterns](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/grok-processor.md#trace-match). The `GROK` command is not subject to [Grok watchdog settings](/reference/ingestion-tools/enrich-processor/grok-processor.md#grok-watchdog).

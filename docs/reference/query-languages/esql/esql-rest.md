# Use the {{esql}} REST API [esql-rest]

::::{tip}
The [Search and filter with {{esql}}](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-search-tutorial.md) tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to the {{esql}} `_query` API.
::::

## Overview [esql-rest-overview]

The [`_query` API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-esql) accepts an {{esql}} query string in the `query` parameter, runs it, and returns the results. For example:

```console
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "query": "FROM library | KEEP author, name, page_count, release_date | SORT page_count DESC | LIMIT 5"
}
```

Which returns:

```text
     author      |        name        |  page_count   | release_date
-----------------+--------------------+---------------+------------------------
Peter F. Hamilton|Pandora's Star      |768            |2004-03-02T00:00:00.000Z
Vernor Vinge     |A Fire Upon the Deep|613            |1992-06-01T00:00:00.000Z
Frank Herbert    |Dune                |604            |1965-06-01T00:00:00.000Z
Alastair Reynolds|Revelation Space    |585            |2000-03-15T00:00:00.000Z
James S.A. Corey |Leviathan Wakes     |561            |2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z
```


### Run the {{esql}} query API in Console [esql-kibana-console]

We recommend using [Console](docs-content://explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md) to run the {{esql}} query API, because of its rich autocomplete features.

When creating the query, using triple quotes (`"""`) allows you to use special characters like quotes (`"`) without having to escape them. They also make it easier to write multi-line requests.

```console
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | KEEP author, name, page_count, release_date
    | SORT page_count DESC
    | LIMIT 5
  """
}
```

### Response formats [esql-rest-format]

{{esql}} can return the data in the following human readable and binary formats. You can set the format by specifying the `format` parameter in the URL or by setting the `Accept` or `Content-Type` HTTP header.

For example:

```console
POST /_query?format=yaml
```

::::{note}
The URL parameter takes precedence over the HTTP headers. If neither is specified then the response is returned in the same format as the request.
::::

#### Structured formats

Complete responses with metadata. Useful for automatic parsing.

| `format` | HTTP header | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `json` | `application/json` | [JSON](https://www.json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) human-readable format |
| `yaml` | `application/yaml` | [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language) human-readable format |

#### Tabular formats

Query results only, without metadata. Useful for quick and manual data previews.

| `format` | HTTP header | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `csv` | `text/csv` | [Comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) |
| `tsv` | `text/tab-separated-values` | [Tab-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) |
| `txt` | `text/plain` | CLI-like representation |

::::{tip}
The `csv` format accepts a formatting URL query attribute, `delimiter`, which indicates which character should be used to separate the CSV values. It defaults to comma (`,`) and cannot take any of the following values: double quote (`"`), carriage-return (`\r`) and new-line (`\n`). The tab (`\t`) can also not be used. Use the `tsv` format instead.
::::

#### Binary formats

Compact binary encoding. To be used by applications.

| `format` | HTTP header | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cbor` | `application/cbor` | [Concise Binary Object Representation](https://cbor.io/) |
| `smile` | `application/smile` | [Smile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(data_interchange_format)) binary data format similarto CBOR |
| `arrow` | `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream` | **Experimental.** [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) dataframes, [IPC streaming format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-streaming-format) |


### Filtering using {{es}} Query DSL [esql-rest-filtering]

Specify a Query DSL query in the `filter` parameter to filter the set of documents that an {{esql}} query runs on.

```console
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | KEEP author, name, page_count, release_date
    | SORT page_count DESC
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "filter": {
    "range": {
      "page_count": {
        "gte": 100,
        "lte": 200
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which returns:

```text
    author     |                name                |  page_count   | release_date
---------------+------------------------------------+---------------+------------------------
Douglas Adams  |The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|180            |1979-10-12T00:00:00.000Z
```


### Columnar results [esql-rest-columnar]

By default, {{esql}} returns results as rows. For example, `FROM` returns each individual document as one row. For the `json`, `yaml`, `cbor` and `smile` [formats](#esql-rest-format), {{esql}} can return the results in a columnar fashion where one row represents all the values of a certain column in the results.

```console
POST /_query?format=json
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | KEEP author, name, page_count, release_date
    | SORT page_count DESC
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "columnar": true
}
```

Which returns:

```console-result
{
  "took": 28,
  "is_partial": false,
  "columns": [
    {"name": "author", "type": "text"},
    {"name": "name", "type": "text"},
    {"name": "page_count", "type": "integer"},
    {"name": "release_date", "type": "date"}
  ],
  "values": [
    ["Peter F. Hamilton", "Vernor Vinge", "Frank Herbert", "Alastair Reynolds", "James S.A. Corey"],
    ["Pandora's Star", "A Fire Upon the Deep", "Dune", "Revelation Space", "Leviathan Wakes"],
    [768, 613, 604, 585, 561],
    ["2004-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "1992-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "1965-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "2000-03-15T00:00:00.000Z", "2011-06-02T00:00:00.000Z"]
  ]
}
```


### Returning localized results [esql-locale-param]

Use the `locale` parameter in the request body to return results (especially dates) formatted per the conventions of the locale. If `locale` is not specified, defaults to `en-US` (English). Refer to [JDK Supported Locales](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-suported-locales.html).

Syntax: the `locale` parameter accepts language tags in the (case-insensitive) format `xy` and `xy-XY`.

For example, to return a month name in French:

```console
POST /_query
{
  "locale": "fr-FR",
  "query": """
          ROW birth_date_string = "2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
          | EVAL birth_date = date_parse(birth_date_string)
          | EVAL month_of_birth = DATE_FORMAT("MMMM",birth_date)
          | LIMIT 5
   """
}
```


### Passing parameters to a query [esql-rest-params]

Values, for example for a condition, can be passed to a query "inline", by integrating the value in the query string itself:

```console
POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", release_date)
    | WHERE page_count > 300 AND author == "Frank Herbert"
    | STATS count = COUNT(*) by year
    | WHERE count > 0
    | LIMIT 5
  """
}
```

To avoid any attempts of hacking or code injection, extract the values in a separate list of parameters. Use question mark placeholders (`?`) in the query string for each of the parameters:

```console
POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", release_date)
    | WHERE page_count > ? AND author == ?
    | STATS count = COUNT(*) by year
    | WHERE count > ?
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "params": [300, "Frank Herbert", 0]
}
```

The parameters can be named parameters or positional parameters.

Named parameters use question mark placeholders (`?`) followed by a string.

```console
POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", release_date)
    | WHERE page_count > ?page_count AND author == ?author
    | STATS count = COUNT(*) by year
    | WHERE count > ?count
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "params": [{"page_count" : 300}, {"author" : "Frank Herbert"}, {"count" : 0}]
}
```

Positional parameters use question mark placeholders (`?`) followed by an integer.

```console
POST /_query
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_EXTRACT("year", release_date)
    | WHERE page_count > ?1 AND author == ?2
    | STATS count = COUNT(*) by year
    | WHERE count > ?3
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "params": [300, "Frank Herbert", 0]
}
```


### Running an async {{esql}} query [esql-rest-async-query]

The [{{esql}} async query API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-esql-async-query) lets you asynchronously execute a query request, monitor its progress, and retrieve results when they become available.

Executing an {{esql}} query is commonly quite fast, however queries across large data sets or frozen data can take some time. To avoid long waits, run an async {{esql}} query.

Queries initiated by the async query API may return results or not. The `wait_for_completion_timeout` property determines how long to wait for the results. If the results are not available by this time, a [query id](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-esql-async-query#esql-async-query-api-response-body-query-id) is returned which can be later used to retrieve the results. For example:

```console
POST /_query/async
{
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL year = DATE_TRUNC(1 YEARS, release_date)
    | STATS MAX(page_count) BY year
    | SORT year
    | LIMIT 5
  """,
  "wait_for_completion_timeout": "2s"
}
```

If the results are not available within the given timeout period, 2 seconds in this case, no results are returned but rather a response that includes:

* A query ID
* An `is_running` value of *true*, indicating the query is ongoing

The query continues to run in the background without blocking other requests.

```console-result
{
  "id": "FmNJRUZ1YWZCU3dHY1BIOUhaenVSRkEaaXFlZ3h4c1RTWFNocDdnY2FSaERnUTozNDE=",
  "is_running": true
}
```

To check the progress of an async query, use the [{{esql}} async query get API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-esql-async-query-get) with the query ID. Specify how long youâ€™d like to wait for complete results in the `wait_for_completion_timeout` parameter.

```console
GET /_query/async/FmNJRUZ1YWZCU3dHY1BIOUhaenVSRkEaaXFlZ3h4c1RTWFNocDdnY2FSaERnUTozNDE=?wait_for_completion_timeout=30s
```

If the responseâ€™s `is_running` value is `false`, the query has finished and the results are returned, along with the `took` time for the query.

```console-result
{
  "is_running": false,
  "took": 48,
  "columns": ...
}
```

To stop a running async query and return the results computed so far, use the [async stop API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-esql-async-query-stop) with the query ID.

```console
POST /_query/async/FmNJRUZ1YWZCU3dHY1BIOUhaenVSRkEaaXFlZ3h4c1RTWFNocDdnY2FSaERnUTozNDE=/stop
```
The query will be stopped and the response will contain the results computed so far. The response format is the same as the `get` API.

```console-result
{
  "is_running": false,
  "took": 48,
  "is_partial": true,
  "columns": ...
}
```
This API can be used to retrieve results even if the query has already completed, as long as it's within the `keep_alive` window.
The `is_partial` field indicates result completeness. A value of `true` means the results are potentially incomplete.

Use the [{{esql}} async query delete API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-esql-async-query-delete) to delete an async query before the `keep_alive` period ends. If the query is still running, {{es}} cancels it.

```console
DELETE /_query/async/FmdMX2pIang3UWhLRU5QS0lqdlppYncaMUpYQ05oSkpTc3kwZ21EdC1tbFJXQToxOTI=
```

::::{note}
You will also receive the async ID and running status in the `X-Elasticsearch-Async-Id` and `X-Elasticsearch-Async-Is-Running` HTTP headers of the response, respectively.
Useful if you use a tabular text format like `txt`, `csv` or `tsv`, as you won't receive those fields in the body there.

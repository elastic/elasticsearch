# {{esql}} dense vector functions [esql-dense-vector-functions]

{{esql}} supports dense vector functions for vector similarity calculations and
k-nearest neighbor search.
Dsense vector functions work with [
`dense_vector` fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/dense-vector.md)
and require appropriate field mappings.

{{esql}} supports these vector functions:

  "description" : "Calculates the per-second average rate of increase of a counter. Rate calculations account for breaks in monotonicity, such as counter resets when a service restarts, and extrapolate values within each bucketed time interval. Rate is the most appropriate aggregate function for counters. It is only allowed in a STATS command under a `TS` source command, to be properly applied per time series.",

### CASE
Accepts pairs of conditions and values. The function returns the value that
belongs to the first condition that evaluates to `true`.

If the number of arguments is odd, the last argument is the default value which
is returned when no condition matches. If the number of arguments is even, and
no condition matches, the function returns `null`.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL type = CASE(
    languages <= 1, "monolingual",
    languages <= 2, "bilingual",
     "polyglot")
| KEEP emp_no, languages, type
```

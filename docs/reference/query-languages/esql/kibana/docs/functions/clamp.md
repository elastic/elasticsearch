### CLAMP
Clamps the values of all samples to have a lower limit of min and an upper limit of max.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS bytes_in = sum(network.bytes_in),
        // our network cards are rate-limited to 200bps so we clamp to that (just an example)
        clamped_network_bytes_in = sum(clamp(network.bytes_in, 0, 200))
        BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```

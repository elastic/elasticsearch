### CLAMP MAX
Limits (or clamps) all input sample values to an upper bound of max. Any value above max is reduced to max.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```

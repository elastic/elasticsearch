### CLAMP MIN
Limits (or clamps) all input sample values to a lower bound of min. Any value below min is set to min.

```esql
FROM k8s
| STATS full_clamped_cost=sum(clamp(network.cost, 1, 2)), clamped_cost=sum(clamp_max(network.cost, 1)), clamped_min_cost=sum(clamp_min(network.cost, 10)) BY time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp,1minute)
```

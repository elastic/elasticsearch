### COPY SIGN
Returns a value with the magnitude of the first argument and the sign of the second argument.
This function is similar to Java's Math.copySign(double magnitude, double sign) which is
similar to `copysign` from [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL cs1 = COPY_SIGN(salary, LEAST(salary_change))
```

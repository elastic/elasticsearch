### DECAY
Calculates a relevance score that decays based on the distance of a numeric, spatial or date type value from a target origin, using configurable decay functions.

```esql
FROM employees
| EVAL decay_result = decay(salary, 0, 100000, {"offset": 5, "decay": 0.5, "type": "linear"})
| SORT decay_result DESC
```

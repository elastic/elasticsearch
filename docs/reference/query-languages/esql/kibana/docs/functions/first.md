### FIRST
This function calculates the earliest occurrence of the search field
(the first parameter), where sorting order is determined by the sort
field (the second parameter). Both fields support null, single-valued,
and multi-valued input. If the earliest sort field value appears in
multiple documents, this function is allowed to return any corresponding
search field value. Null values of the sort field always sort last.

ROW row = [
  #       @timestamp        |  name   | number
  "2025-11-25T00:00:00.000Z | alpha   | ",

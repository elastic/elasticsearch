### FLOOR
Round a number down to the nearest integer.

```esql
ROW a=1.8
| EVAL a=FLOOR(a)
```
Note: This is a noop for `long` (including unsigned) and `integer`.
For `double` this picks the closest `double` value to the integer
similar to [Math.floor](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#floor(double)).

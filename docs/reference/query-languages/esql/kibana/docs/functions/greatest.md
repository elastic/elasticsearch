### GREATEST
Returns the maximum value from multiple columns. This is similar to <<esql-mv_max>>
except it is intended to run on multiple columns at once.

```
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL g = GREATEST(a, b)
```
Note: When run on `keyword` or `text` fields, this returns the last string in alphabetical order. When run on `boolean` columns this will return `true` if any values are `true`.

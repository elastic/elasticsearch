### GREATEST
Returns the maximum value from multiple columns. This is similar to [`MV_MAX`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/mv-functions#esql-mv_max)
except it is intended to run on multiple columns at once.

```esql
ROW a = 10, b = 20
| EVAL g = GREATEST(a, b)
```
Note: When run on `keyword` or `text` fields, this returns the last string in alphabetical order. When run on `boolean` columns this will return `true` if any values are `true`.

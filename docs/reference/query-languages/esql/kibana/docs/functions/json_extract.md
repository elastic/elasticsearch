### JSON EXTRACT
Extracts a value from a JSON string using a dot-notation path expression.
Path matching is case-sensitive (per the JSON specification).
Returns the extracted value as a keyword string. String values are returned without
surrounding quotes, numbers and booleans are returned as their string representation,
and objects or arrays are returned as JSON strings. Returns `null` if either parameter
is `null` or if the extracted JSON value is `null`. Returns `null` and emits a warning
if the input is not valid JSON, the path does not exist, the array index is out of bounds,
or the path attempts to traverse through a non-object/non-array value.

```esql
ROW json = "{\\"name\\":\\"Alice\\",\\"age\\":30}"
| EVAL name = JSON_EXTRACT(json, "name")
```

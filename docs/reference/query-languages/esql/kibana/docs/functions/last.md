### LAST
This function calculates the latest occurrence of the search field
(the first parameter), where sorting order is determined by the sort
field (the second parameter). This sorting order is always ascending
and null values always sort last. Both fields support null,
single-valued, and multi-valued input. If the latest sort field
value appears in multiple documents, this function is allowed to
return any corresponding search field value.

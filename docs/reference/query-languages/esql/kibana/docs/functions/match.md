### MATCH
Use `MATCH` to perform a [match query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query) on the specified field.
Using `MATCH` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.

```esql
FROM books
| WHERE MATCH(author, "Faulkner")
```

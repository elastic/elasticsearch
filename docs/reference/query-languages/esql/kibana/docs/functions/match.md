### MATCH
Use `MATCH` to perform a [match query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query) on the specified field.
Using `MATCH` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.

Match can be used on fields from the text family like [text](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/text) and [semantic_text](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text),
as well as other field types like keyword, boolean, dates, and numeric types.
When Match is used on a [semantic_text](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/semantic-text) field, it will perform a semantic query on the field.

Match can use [function named parameters](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-syntax#esql-function-named-params) to specify additional options for the match query.
All [match query parameters](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query#match-field-params) are supported.

For a simplified syntax, you can use the [match operator](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/operators#esql-match-operator) `:` operator instead of `MATCH`.

`MATCH` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

```esql
FROM books

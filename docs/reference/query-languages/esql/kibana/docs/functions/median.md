### MEDIAN
The value that is greater than half of all values and less than half of all values, also known as the 50% [`PERCENTILE`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-percentile).

```
FROM employees
| STATS MEDIAN(salary), PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
```
Note: Like [`PERCENTILE`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-percentile), `MEDIAN` is [usually approximate](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-percentile-approximate).

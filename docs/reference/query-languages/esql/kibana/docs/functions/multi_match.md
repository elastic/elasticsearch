### MULTI MATCH
Use `MULTI_MATCH` to perform a [multi-match query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query#query-dsl-multi-match-query) on the specified field.
The multi_match query builds on the match query to allow multi-field queries.

```esql
FROM books
| WHERE MULTI_MATCH("Faulkner", author, description)
| KEEP book_no, author
| SORT book_no
| LIMIT 5
```

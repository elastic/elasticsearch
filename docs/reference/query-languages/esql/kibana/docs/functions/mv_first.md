### MV_FIRST
Converts a multivalued expression into a single valued column containing the
first value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits
multivalued columns in a known order like [`SPLIT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-split).

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL first_a = MV_FIRST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

### MV LAST
Converts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last
value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued
columns in a known order like [`SPLIT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/string-functions#esql-split).

```esql
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

### MV_LAST
Converts a multivalue expression into a single valued column containing the last
value. This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued
columns in a known order like [`SPLIT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-split).

```
ROW a="foo;bar;baz"
| EVAL last_a = MV_LAST(SPLIT(a, ";"))
```

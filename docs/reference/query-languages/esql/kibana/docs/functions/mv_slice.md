### MV SLICE
Returns a subset of the multivalued field using the start and end index values.
This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns
in a known order like [`SPLIT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/string-functions#esql-split) or [`MV_SORT`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/mv-functions#esql-mv_sort).

```esql
row a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| eval a1 = mv_slice(a, 1), a2 = mv_slice(a, 2, 3)
```

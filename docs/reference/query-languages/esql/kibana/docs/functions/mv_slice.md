### MV_SLICE
Returns a subset of the multivalued field using the start and end index values.
This is most useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued columns
in a known order like <<esql-split>> or <<esql-mv_sort>>.

```
row a = [1, 2, 2, 3]
| eval a1 = mv_slice(a, 1), a2 = mv_slice(a, 2, 3)
```

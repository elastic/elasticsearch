### PERCENTILE
Returns the value at which a certain percentage of observed values occur. For example, the 95th percentile is the value which is greater than 95% of the observed values and the 50th percentile is the `MEDIAN`.

```esql
FROM employees
| STATS p0 = PERCENTILE(salary,  0)
     , p50 = PERCENTILE(salary, 50)
     , p99 = PERCENTILE(salary, 99)
```

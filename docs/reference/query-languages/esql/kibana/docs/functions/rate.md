### RATE
Calculates the per-second average rate of increase of a [counter](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/data-streams/time-series-data-stream-tsds.md#time-series-metric). Rate calculations account for breaks in monotonicity, such as counter resets when a service restarts, and extrapolate values within each bucketed time interval. Rate is the most appropriate aggregate function for counters. It is only allowed in a [STATS](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/commands/stats-by) command under a [`TS`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/commands/ts) source command, to be properly applied per time series.

```esql
TS k8s
| STATS max_rate=MAX(RATE(network.total_bytes_in)) BY time_bucket = TBUCKET(5minute)
```

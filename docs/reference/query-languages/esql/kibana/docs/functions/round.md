### ROUND
Rounds a number to the specified number of decimal places.
Defaults to 0, which returns the nearest integer. If the
precision is a negative number, rounds to the number of digits left
of the decimal point.

```
FROM employees
| KEEP first_name, last_name, height
| EVAL height_ft = ROUND(height * 3.281, 1)
```

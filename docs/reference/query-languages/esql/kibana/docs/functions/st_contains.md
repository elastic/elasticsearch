### ST CONTAINS
Returns whether the first geometry contains the second geometry.
This is the inverse of the [ST_WITHIN](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/spatial-functions#esql-st_within) function.

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_CONTAINS(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((109.35 18.3, 109.45 18.3, 109.45 18.4, 109.35 18.4, 109.35 18.3))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```

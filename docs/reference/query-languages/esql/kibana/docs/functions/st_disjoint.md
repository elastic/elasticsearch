### ST_DISJOINT
Returns whether the two geometries or geometry columns are disjoint.
This is the inverse of the [ST_INTERSECTS](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators#esql-st_intersects) function.
In mathematical terms: ST_Disjoint(A, B) ⇔ A ⋂ B = ∅

```
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_DISJOINT(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((-10 -60, 120 -60, 120 60, -10 60, -10 -60))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```

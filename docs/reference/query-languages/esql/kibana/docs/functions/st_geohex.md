### ST GEOHEX
Calculates the `geohex`, the H3 cell-id, of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use [TO_STRING](#esql-to_string) to convert the result to a string,
[TO_LONG](#esql-to_long) to convert it to a `long`, or [TO_GEOSHAPE](esql-to_geoshape.md) to calculate
the `geo_shape` bounding geometry.

These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query)
and the [`geohex_grid` aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation).

```esql
FROM airports
| EVAL geohex = ST_GEOHEX(location, 1)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geohex
| WHERE count >= 10
| EVAL geohexString = TO_STRING(geohex)
| KEEP count, centroid, geohexString
| SORT count DESC, geohexString ASC
```

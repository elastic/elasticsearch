### ST GEOHEX
Calculates the `geohex`, the H3 cell-id, of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use [ST_GEOHEX_TO_STRING](#esql-st_geohex_to_string) to convert the result to a string.
Or use [ST_GEOHEX_TO_GEOSHAPE](#esql-st_geohex_to_geoshape) to convert either the long or string `geohex` to a
POLYGON geo_shape.

These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query)
and the [`geohex_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation).

```esql
FROM airports
| EVAL geohex = ST_GEOHEX(location, 1)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geohex
| WHERE count >= 10
| EVAL geohexString = ST_GEOHEX_TO_STRING(geohex)
| KEEP count, centroid, geohexString
| SORT count DESC, geohexString ASC
```

### ST GEOTILE
Calculates the `geotile` of the supplied geo_point at the specified precision.
The result is long encoded. Use [ST_GEOTILE_TO_STRING](#esql-st_geotile_to_string) to convert the result to a string.
Or use [ST_GEOTILE_TO_GEOSHAPE](#esql-st_geotile_to_geoshape) to convert either the long or string `geotile` to a
POLYGON geo_shape.

These functions are related to the [`geo_grid` query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-geo-grid-query)
and the [`geotile_grid` aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation).

```esql
FROM airports
| EVAL geotile = ST_GEOTILE(location, 2)
| STATS
    count = COUNT(*),
    centroid = ST_CENTROID_AGG(location)
      BY geotile
| EVAL geotileString = ST_GEOTILE_TO_STRING(geotile)
| SORT count DESC, geotileString ASC
| KEEP count, centroid, geotileString
```

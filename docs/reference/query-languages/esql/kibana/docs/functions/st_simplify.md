### ST SIMPLIFY
Simplifies the input geometry by applying the Douglas-Peucker algorithm with a specified tolerance. Vertices that fall within the tolerance distance from the simplified shape are removed. Note that the resulting geometry may be invalid, even if the original input was valid.

```esql

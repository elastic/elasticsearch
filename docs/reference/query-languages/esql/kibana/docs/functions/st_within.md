### ST WITHIN
Returns whether the first geometry is within the second geometry.
This is the inverse of the [ST_CONTAINS](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/spatial-functions#esql-st_contains) function.

```esql
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE ST_WITHIN(city_boundary, TO_GEOSHAPE("POLYGON((109.1 18.15, 109.6 18.15, 109.6 18.65, 109.1 18.65, 109.1 18.15))"))
| KEEP abbrev, airport, region, city, city_location
```

### ST_XMIN
Extracts the minimum value of the `x` coordinates from the supplied geometry.
If the geometry is of type `geo_point` or `geo_shape` this is equivalent to extracting the minimum `longitude` value.

```
FROM airport_city_boundaries
| WHERE abbrev == "CPH"
| EVAL envelope = ST_ENVELOPE(city_boundary)
| EVAL xmin = ST_XMIN(envelope), xmax = ST_XMAX(envelope), ymin = ST_YMIN(envelope), ymax = ST_YMAX(envelope)
| KEEP abbrev, airport, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax
```

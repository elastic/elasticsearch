### TEXT EMBEDDING
Converts a constant text into dense vector embeddings using a inference endpoint. The resulting vectors can be used for knn search, and other vector-based operations. Requires an inference endpoint configured with the `text_embedding` task type. See [Inference API documentation](docs-content://explore-analyze/elastic-inference/inference-api.md) for how to create inference endpoints.

```esql
ROW input="Who is Victor Hugo?"
| EVAL embedding = TEXT_EMBEDDING("Who is Victor Hugo?", "test_dense_inference")
;
```

### TEXT EMBEDDING
Generates dense vector embeddings from text input using a specified [inference endpoint](docs-content://explore-analyze/elastic-inference/inference-api.md). Use this function to generate query vectors for KNN searches against your vectorized data or others dense vector based operations.

```esql
FROM dense_vector_text METADATA _score
| WHERE KNN(text_embedding_field, TEXT_EMBEDDING("be excellent to each other", "test_dense_inference"))
```

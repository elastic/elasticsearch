### TEXT EMBEDDING
Generates dense vector embeddings from text input using a specified [inference endpoint](docs-content://explore-analyze/elastic-inference/inference-api.md). Use this function to generate query vectors for KNN searches against your vectorized data or others dense vector based operations.

```esql
ROW input="Who is Victor Hugo?"
| EVAL embedding = TEXT_EMBEDDING("Who is Victor Hugo?", "test_dense_inference")
```

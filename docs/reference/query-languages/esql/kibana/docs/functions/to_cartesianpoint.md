### TO CARTESIANPOINT
Converts an input value to a `cartesian_point` value.
A string will only be successfully converted if it respects the
[WKT Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format.

```esql
ROW wkt = ["POINT(4297.11 -1475.53)", "POINT(7580.93 2272.77)"]
| MV_EXPAND wkt
| EVAL pt = TO_CARTESIANPOINT(wkt)
```

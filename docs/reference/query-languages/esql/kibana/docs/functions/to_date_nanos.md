### TO DATE NANOS
Converts an input to a nanosecond-resolution date value (aka date_nanos).

```esql
FROM date_nanos
| WHERE MV_MIN(nanos) < TO_DATE_NANOS("2023-10-23T12:27:28.948Z")
    AND millis > "2000-01-01"
| SORT nanos DESC
```
Note: The range for date nanos is 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z to 2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775807Z, attempting to convert values outside of that range will result in null with a warning.  Additionally, integers cannot be converted into date nanos, as the range of integer nanoseconds only covers about 2 seconds after epoch.

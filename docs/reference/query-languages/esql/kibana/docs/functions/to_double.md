### TO DOUBLE
Converts an input value to a double value. If the input parameter is of a date type,
its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time),
converted to double. Boolean `true` will be converted to double `1.0`, `false` to `0.0`.

```esql
ROW str1 = "5.20128E11", str2 = "foo"
| EVAL dbl = TO_DOUBLE("520128000000"), dbl1 = TO_DOUBLE(str1), dbl2 = TO_DOUBLE(str2)
```

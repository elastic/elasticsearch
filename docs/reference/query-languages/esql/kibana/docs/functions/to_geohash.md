### TO GEOHASH
Converts an input value to a `geohash` value.
A string will only be successfully converted if it respects the
`geohash` format, as described for the
[geohash grid aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohashgrid-aggregation).

```esql
ROW string = "u3bu"
| EVAL geohash = TO_GEOHASH(string)
```

### TO GEOHEX
Converts an input value to a `geohex` value.
A string will only be successfully converted if it respects the
`geohex` format, as described for the
[geohex grid aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geohexgrid-aggregation).

```esql
ROW string = "841f059ffffffff"
| EVAL geohex = TO_GEOHEX(string)
```

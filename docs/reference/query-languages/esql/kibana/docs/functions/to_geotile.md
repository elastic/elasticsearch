### TO GEOTILE
Converts an input value to a `geotile` value.
A string will only be successfully converted if it respects the
`geotile` format, as described for the
[geotile grid aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-geotilegrid-aggregation).

```esql
ROW string = "4/8/5"
| EVAL geotile = TO_GEOTILE(string)
```

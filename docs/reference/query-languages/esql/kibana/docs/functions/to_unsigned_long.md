### TO UNSIGNED LONG
Converts an input value to an unsigned long value. If the input parameter is of a date type,
its value will be interpreted as milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), converted to unsigned long.
Boolean `true` will be converted to unsigned long `1`, `false` to `0`.

```esql
ROW str1 = "2147483648", str2 = "2147483648.2", str3 = "foo"
| EVAL long1 = TO_UNSIGNED_LONG(str1), long2 = TO_ULONG(str2), long3 = TO_UL(str3)
```

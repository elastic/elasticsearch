### URL ENCODE COMPONENT
URL-encodes the input. All characters are [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) except for alphanumerics, `.`, `-`, `_`, and `~`. Spaces are encoded as `%20`.

```esql
ROW u = "https://example.com/?x=foo bar&y=baz"
| EVAL u = URL_ENCODE_COMPONENT(u)
```

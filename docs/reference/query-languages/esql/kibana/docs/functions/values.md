### VALUES
Returns all values in a group as a multivalued field. The order of the returned values isn't guaranteed. If you need the values returned in order use <<esql-mv_sort>>.

```
  FROM employees
| EVAL first_letter = SUBSTRING(first_name, 0, 1)
| STATS first_name=MV_SORT(VALUES(first_name)) BY first_letter
| SORT first_letter
```

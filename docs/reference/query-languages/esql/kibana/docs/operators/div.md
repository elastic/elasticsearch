### DIVIDE `/`
Divide one number by another. If either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields) then the result is `null`.

Note: Division of two integer types will yield an integer result, rounding towards 0. If you need floating point division, [`Cast (::)`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/operators#esql-cast-operator) one of the arguments to a `DOUBLE`.

### DIV
Divide one number by another. If either field is [multivalued](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields.md) then the result is `null`.

Note: Division of two integer types will yield an integer result, rounding towards 0. If you need floating point division, [`Cast (::)`](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-functions-operators.md#esql-cast-operator) one of the arguments to a `DOUBLE`.

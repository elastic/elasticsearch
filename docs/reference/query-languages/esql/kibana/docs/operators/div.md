### DIVIDE `/`
Divide one value by another. For numeric operands, if either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields)
then the result is `null`.
note = "Division of two integer types will yield an integer result, rounding towards 0. "
+ "If you need floating point division, [`Cast (::)`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/functions-operators/operators#esql-cast-operator) one of the arguments to a `DOUBLE`.
For dense_vector operations, both arguments should be dense_vectors. Inequal vector dimensions generate null result.

### EQUALS
Check if two fields are equal. If either field is [multivalued](/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields.md) then the result is `null`.

Note: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an [mapping-index](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-index.md) and [doc-values](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values.md).

### GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL
Check if one field is greater than or equal to another. If either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields) then the result is `null`.

Note: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an [mapping-index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-index) and [doc-values](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values).

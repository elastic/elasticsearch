### MATCH_OPERATOR
Use the match operator (`:`) to perform a <<query-dsl-match-query,match query>> on the specified field.
Using `:` is equivalent to using the `match` query in the Elasticsearch Query DSL.

The match operator is equivalent to the <<esql-match,match function>>.

For using the function syntax, or adding <<match-field-params,match query parameters>>, you can use the
<<esql-match,match function>>.

`:` returns true if the provided query matches the row.

```
FROM books 
| WHERE MATCH(author, "Faulkner")
| KEEP book_no, author 
| SORT book_no 
| LIMIT 5
```

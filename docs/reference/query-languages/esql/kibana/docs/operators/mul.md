### MULTIPLY `*`
Multiply two values together. For numeric fields, if either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields)
then the result is `null`. For dense_vector operations, both arguments should be dense_vectors. Inequal vector dimensions generate
null result.

### NOT EQUALS `!=`
Check if two fields are unequal. If either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields) then the result is `null`.

Note: This is pushed to the underlying search index if one side of the comparison is constant and the other side is a field in the index that has both an [mapping-index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/mapping-index) and [doc-values](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values).

### SUBTRACT `-`
Subtract one value from another. In case of numeric fields, if either field is [multivalued](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/esql-multivalued-fields)
then the result is `null`. For dense_vector fields, both arguments should be dense_vectors. Inequal vector dimensions generate
null result.

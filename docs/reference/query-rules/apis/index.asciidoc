<<search-using-query-rules,Query rules>> allow you to configure per-query rules that are applied at query time to queries that match the specific rule.
Query rules are organized into _rulesets_, collections of query rules that are matched against incoming queries.
Query rules are applied using the <<query-dsl-rule-query, rule query>>.

If a query matches one or more rules in the ruleset, the query is re-written to apply the rules before searching.
This allows pinning documents for only queries that match a specific term.

Use the following APIs to manage query rulesets:

* <<put-query-ruleset>>
* <<get-query-ruleset>>
* <<list-query-rulesets>>
* <<delete-query-ruleset>>
* <<put-query-rule>>
* <<get-query-rule>>
* <<delete-query-rule>>
* preview:[] <<test-query-ruleset>>

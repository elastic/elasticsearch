= Quick starts

Use these quick starts to get hands-on experience with the {es} APIs.
Unless otherwise noted, these examples will use queries written in <<query-dsl,Query DSL>> syntax.

[[quickstart-requirements]]
== Requirements

You'll need a running {es} cluster, together with {kib} to use the Dev Tools API Console.
Run the following command in your terminal to set up a <<run-elasticsearch-locally,single-node local cluster in Docker>>:

[source,sh]
----
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
----
// NOTCONSOLE

Alternatively, refer to our <<elasticsearch-intro-deploy,other deployment options>>.

.Working in Python
******************

If you're interested in using {es} with Python, check out Elastic Search Labs:

* https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs[`elasticsearch-labs` repository]: Contains a range of Python https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/tree/main/notebooks[notebooks] and https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/tree/main/example-apps[example apps].
* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/search-tutorial/welcome[Tutorial]: This walks you through building a complete search solution with {es} from the ground up using Flask.

= Reference architectures

Elasticsearch reference architectures are blueprints for deploying, managing, and optimizing Elasticsearch clusters tailored to different use cases. Whether you're handling logs, metrics, or sophisticated search applications, these reference architectures ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization. Use these guidelines to deploy Elasticsearch for your use case, with minimal risk and complexity.

These architectures are designed by Elastic Solutions Architects to provide standardized, proven solutions that help users follow best practices when deploying Elasticsearch. Some of the key areas of focus are listed below. 

* Infrastructure setup
* Data ingestion
* Indexing
* Search performance
* High availability 

TIP: These architectures are specific to running your deployment on-premises or cloud. If you are using Elastic serverless your Elasticsearch clusters are autoscaled and fully managed by Elastic. For all the deployment options, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro-deploy.html[Run Elasticsearch].

These reference architectures are recommendations and should be adapted to fit your specific environment and needs. Each solution can vary based on the unique requirements and conditions of your deployment. In these architectures we discuss about how to deploy cluster components. For information about designing ingest architectures to feed content into your cluster, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ingest/current/use-case-arch.html[Ingest architectures]

| *Architecture* | *When to use*
| <<elastic-cloud-architecture>>

This architecture is a Hot-Frozen architecture on the Elastic Cloud that is optimized for time series datasets while keeping all of the data fully searchable. It maintains index structures that allow for fast search in cloud object stores. 

a| 
* You want to use the best practices Elastic Cloud implements to run your cluster.
* You want to leverage cloud provider hardware that have been extensively tested.
* You need long retention periods with the ability to search indices in an object store cost-effectively.
* Use cloud provider's highly available object stores for data integrity so you don't have to depend on your own.

| <<three-availability-zones>>

The three zone architecture is used for rolling upgrades and failure domains locally because non-disruptive upgrades and other plans or unplanned outages are more sustainable with 33% of the resources off-line and 66% available

a| 
* When you need an architecture that is resilient to unplanned outages

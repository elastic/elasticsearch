Monitoring::
* By default when you install {xpack}, monitoring is enabled but data collection
is disabled. To enable data collection, use the new
`xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting. You can update this setting by
using the <<cluster-update-settings,Cluster Update Settings API>>. For more
information, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

Security::
* The legacy `XPackExtension` extension mechanism has been removed and replaced
with an SPI based extension mechanism that is installed and built as an
elasticsearch plugin.

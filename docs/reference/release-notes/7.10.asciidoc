[[security-updates-7.10.2]]
=== Security updates

* An information disclosure flaw was found in the {es} async search API.
Users who execute an async search will store the HTTP headers.
A user with the ability to read the `.tasks` index could obtain
sensitive request headers of other users in the cluster.
All versions of {es} between 7.7.0 and 7.10.1 are affected by this flaw.
You must upgrade to {es} version 7.10.2 to obtain the fix.

[[security-updates-7.10.0]]
=== Security updates

* {es} versions before 7.10.0 and 6.8.14 have an information
disclosure issue when audit logging and the `emit_request_body` option are
enabled. The {es} audit log could contain sensitive information,
such as password hashes or authentication tokens. This could allow an
{es} administrator to view these details.
You must upgrade to {es} version 7.10.0 to obtain the fix.

=== Known issues

* SQL: If a `WHERE` clause contains at least two relational operators joined by
`AND`, of which one is a comparison (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`) and another one is
an inequality (`!=`, `<>`), both against literals or foldable expressions, the
inequality will be ignored. The workaround is to substitute the inequality
with a `NOT IN` operator.

We have fixed this issue in {es} 7.10.1 and later versions. For more details,
see {es-issue}65488[#65488].

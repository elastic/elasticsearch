[[known-issues-7.11.0]]
[discrete]
=== Known issues

* Integration with <<active-directory-realm, Active Directory realms>> and
  <<ldap-realm, LDAP realms>> is impacted by an issue that prevents
  Elasticsearch from starting. If you have configured an Active Directory or
  LDAP realm, then Elasticseach will fail to start with an error message
  indicating that `Could not initialize class com.unboundid.util.Debug`. This
  exception is fatal. If you encounter this during an upgrade, because
  Elasticsearch failed during node construction, you can safely downgrade to
  your previous version of Elasticsearch. Note: these downgrade instructions
  only apply if you encounter this specific error message; in general,
  downgrades are not safe. Elasticsearch 7.11.1 will contain a fix for this
  issue. For more details, see {es-issue}68838[#68838].

* If autoscaling is enabled for machine learning, the administrator of the cluster
  should increase the cluster setting `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` to the maximum value of `512`. This allows autoscaling
  to run reliably as it relies on assigning jobs only via memory. Having
  `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` as a small number may cause autoscaling to behave unexpectedly.

* If autoscaling is enabled and job assignment takes an inordinate amount of time, scaling
  sizes may increase much higher than required. Elasticsearch 7.13.0 contains a fix for this.
  For more details, see {es-issue}72509[#72509]

[[fips-140-2-compliance-7.11.0]]
=== FIPS 140-2 compliance

NOTE: If you don’t run {es} in FIPS 140-2 mode, skip this section.

In some cases, such as when using the Bouncy Castle FIPS module in
approved only mode, {es} may raise unexpected exceptions that prevent startup.

In {es} 7.11.0, we added a new
{ref}/security-settings.html#password-hashing-algorithms[PBKDF2-compatible
hashing algorithm] to fix this. For more information, see the
{ref}/fips-140-compliance.html[{es} FIPS 140-2 documentation].

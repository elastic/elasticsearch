=== Security updates

* A memory disclosure vulnerability was identified in {es}'s error reporting. A
user with the ability to submit arbitrary queries to {es} could submit a
malformed query that would result in an error message returned containing
previously used portions of a data buffer. This buffer could contain sensitive
information, such as {es} documents or authentication details. All versions of
{es} prior to 7.13.4 are affected by this flaw. There is no known workaround for
this issue. You must upgrade to {es} version 7.13.4 to obtain the fix.

=== Security updates

* An uncontrolled recursion vulnerability that could lead to a
denial of service attack was identified in the {es} Grok parser.
A user with the ability to submit arbitrary queries to {es} could create
a malicious Grok query that will crash the {es} node.
All versions of {es} prior to 7.13.3 are affected by this flaw.
You must upgrade to {es} version 7.13.3 to obtain the fix.

// tag::snapshot-repo-corruption-75598-known-issue[]
* Snapshot and restore: If a running snapshot is cancelled while a
previously-started snapshot is still ongoing and a later snapshot is enqueued
then there is a risk that some shard data may be lost from the repository. This
will cause future restore operations to fail. To mitigate this problem, set
`snapshot.max_concurrent_operations: 1` to prevent concurrent snapshot
operations:

PUT _cluster/settings

  "persistent" : {

This issue is fixed in {es} versions 7.14.1 and later. It is not possible to
repair a repository once it is affected by this issue, so you must restore the
repository from a backup, or clear the repository by executing
`DELETE _snapshot/<repository name>/*`, or move to a fresh repository. For more
details, see {es-issue}75598[#75598].

=== Known issues

include::7.12.asciidoc[tag=frozen-tier-79371-known-issue]

* If autoscaling is enabled for machine learning, the administrator of the
cluster should increase the cluster setting `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` to the
maximum value of `512`. This allows autoscaling to run reliably as it relies on
assigning jobs only via memory. Having `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` as a small
number may cause autoscaling to behave unexpectedly.

include::7.9.asciidoc[tag=snapshot-repo-corruption-73456-known-issue]

* If local and remote clusters are on different patch releases, response
serialization fails for requests to a remote cluster that use the
<<search-field-caps,field capabilities API>> with CCS. Because {kib} uses this
API internally, requests to CCS index patterns will also fail.

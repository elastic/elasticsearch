[discrete]
=== Known issues

* {es} fails to parse system index migration data from the cluster
  state (issue: {es-issue}84115[#84115])
* Feature migration refuses to run if all features requiring upgrade have
  encountered errors (issue: {es-issue}83917[#83917])
* Migrating system indices fails for tasks with `mapper_parsing_exception`
  (issue: {es-issue}83779[#83779])

These issues will impact any subsequent upgrade to 8.x, and are fixed in
7.17.1. We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to a later patch
release of 7.17 before upgrading to 8.x.

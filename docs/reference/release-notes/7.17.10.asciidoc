=== Known issues

// tag::no-preventive-gc-issue[]
* High Memory Pressure due to a GC JVM setting change
+
This version of Elasticsearch is bundled with JDK 20. In JDK 20
https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8293861[Preventive GC is disabled by default].
This may lead to increased memory pressure and an increased number of CircuitBreakerExceptions when retrieving large
documents under some load patterns. (issue: {es-issue}99592[#99592])
+
If this change affects your use of Elasticsearch, consider re-enabling the previous behaviour
by adding the JVM arguments `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+G1UsePreventiveGC` (reference:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/20-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8293861[JDK 20 release notes]). It is
important to note that this workaround is temporary and works only with JDK 20, which is bundled with Elasticsearch up
to version 7.17.13 inclusive. Successive versions are bundling JDK 21+, where this setting
https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8297639[has been removed]. Specifying those JVM arguments will prevent the
JVM (and therefore Elasticsearch Nodes) from starting.

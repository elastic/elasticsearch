== {es} version 7.4.0

Also see <<breaking-changes-7.4,Breaking changes in 7.4>>.

[discrete]
=== Known issues

* Applying deletes or updates on an index after it has been shrunk may corrupt
the index. In order to prevent this issue, it is recommended to stop shrinking
read-write indices. For read-only indices, it is recommended to force-merge
indices after shrinking, which significantly reduces the likeliness of this
corruption in the case that deletes/updates would be applied by mistake. This
bug is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions. More details can be found on the
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300[corresponding issue].

* Activating the <<search-slow-log, search slow log>> should be avoided in this version.
Any attempt to log a slow search can throw an AIOOBE due to a bug that
performs concurrent modifications on a shared byte array.
(issue: {es-issue}/48358[#48358])

* Indices created in 6.x with <<date,`date`>> and <<date_nanos,`date_nanos`>> fields using formats
that are incompatible with java.time patterns will cause parsing errors, incorrect date calculations or wrong search results.
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52555
This is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions.

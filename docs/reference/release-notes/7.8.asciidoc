=== Known issues

* SQL: If a `WHERE` clause contains at least two relational operators joined by
`AND`, of which one is a comparison (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`) and another one is
an inequality (`!=`, `<>`), both against literals or foldable expressions, the
inequality will be ignored. The workaround is to substitute the inequality
with a `NOT IN` operator.

We have fixed this issue in {es} 7.10.1 and later versions. For more details,

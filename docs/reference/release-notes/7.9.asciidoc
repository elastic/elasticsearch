[float]
[[security-updates-7.9.0]]
=== Security updates

* A field disclosure flaw was found in {es} when running a scrolling search with
field level security. If a user runs the same query another more privileged user
recently ran, the scrolling search can leak fields that should be hidden. This
could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted
index. All versions of {es} before 7.9.0 and 6.8.12 are affected by this flaw.
You must upgrade to {es} version 7.9.0 or 6.8.12 to obtain the fix.
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7019[CVE-2020-7019]

[[known-issues-7.9.0]]
[discrete]
=== Known issues

* Upgrading to 7.9.0 from an earlier version will result in incorrect mappings
on the {ml} annotations index, and possibly also on the {ml} config index. This
will lead to some pages in the {ml} UI not displaying correctly, and may prevent
{ml-jobs} being created or updated. The best way to avoid this problem if you
read about this known issue before upgrading is to manually update the mappings
on these indices in your old {es} version _before_ upgrading to 7.9.0. If you
find out about the issue after upgrading then reindexing is required to recover.
Full details of the mitigations are in
{ml-docs}/ml-troubleshooting.html#ml-troubleshooting-mappings[Upgrade to 7.9.0 causes incorrect mappings].

* Lucene 8.6.0, on which Elasticsearch 7.9.0 is based,
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9478[contains a memory
  leak]. This memory leak manifests in Elasticsearch when a single document is
  updated repeatedly with a forced refresh. The cluster state storage layer in
  Elasticsearch is based on Lucene and does use single-document updates with
  forced refreshes, meaning that this memory leak manifests in Elasticsearch under
  normal conditions. It also manifests when user-controlled workloads update a
  single document in an index repeatedly with a forced refresh. In both cases,
  the memory leak is around 500 bytes per update, so it does take some time for
  the leak to show any meaningful impact on the system. Symptoms of this memory
  leak are the size of the used heap slowly rising over time, requests
  eventually being rejected by the real memory circuit breaker, and potentially
  out-of-memory errors. A workaround is to restart any nodes exhibiting these
  symptoms.  We are actively working with the Lucene community to release a
  https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/1779[fix] in Lucene 8.6.2 to
  deliver in Elasticsearch 7.9.1 that will address this memory leak.

* SQL: If a `WHERE` clause contains at least two relational operators joined by
`AND`, of which one is a comparison (`<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`) and another one is
an inequality (`!=`, `<>`), both against literals or foldable expressions, the
inequality will be ignored. The workaround is to substitute the inequality
with a `NOT IN` operator.
+
We have fixed this issue in {es} 7.10.1 and later versions. For more details,
see {es-issue}65488[#65488].

// tag::snapshot-repo-corruption-73456-known-issue[]
* Snapshot and restore: If an index is deleted while the cluster is
concurrently taking more than one snapshot then there is a risk that one of the
snapshots may never complete and also that some shard data may be lost from the
repository, causing future restore operations to fail. To mitigate this
problem, set `snapshot.max_concurrent_operations: 1` to prevent concurrent
snapshot operations:
+
[source,console]
----
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "snapshot.max_concurrent_operations" : 1
  }
}
----
+
This issue is fixed in {es} versions 7.13.1 and later. It is not possible to
repair a repository once it is affected by this issue, so you must restore the
repository from a backup, or clear the repository by executing
`DELETE _snapshot/<repository name>/*`, or move to a fresh repository. For more
details, see {es-issue}73456[#73456].

Script Cache::
* Script cache size and rate limiting are per-context {es-pull}55753[#55753] (issue: {es-issue}50152[#50152])

Field capabilities API::
* Constant_keyword fields are now described by their family type `keyword` instead of `constant_keyword` {es-pull}58483[#58483] (issue: {es-issue}53175[#53175])

Snapshot restore throttling::
* Restoring from a snapshot (which is a particular form of recovery) is now
  properly taking recovery throttling into account (i.e. the
  `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` setting).
  The `max_restore_bytes_per_sec` setting is also now defaulting to
  unlimited, whereas previously it was set to `40mb`, which is the
  default that's used for `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec`. This means
  that no behavioral change will be observed by clusters where the recovery
  and restore settings had not been adapted from the defaults. {es-pull}58658[#58658]

Thread pool write queue size::
* The WRITE thread pool default queue size (`thread_pool.write.size`) has been
  increased from 200 to 10000. A small queue size (200) caused issues when users
  wanted to send small indexing requests with a high client count. Additional
  memory-oriented back pressure has been introduced with the
  `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` setting. This setting configures a limit to
  the number of bytes allowed to be consumed by outstanding indexing requests.
  {es-issue}59263[#59263]

Dangling indices::
* Automatically importing dangling indices is now deprecated, disabled by
  default, and will be removed in {es} 8.0. See the

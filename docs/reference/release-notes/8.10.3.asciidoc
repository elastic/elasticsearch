include::8.10.0.asciidoc[tag=repositorydata-format-change]

// tag::no-preventive-gc-issue[]
* High Memory Pressure due to a GC change in JDK 21
+
This version of Elasticsearch is bundled with JDK 21. In JDK 21
https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8297639[Preventive GC has been removed].
This may lead to increased memory pressure and an increased number of CircuitBreakerExceptions when retrieving large
documents under some particular load. (issue: {es-issue}99592[#99592])
+
If you needed to explicitly <<known-issues-8.10.0,enable Preventive GC for your workload in a previous Elasticsearch
version>>, we recommend you avoid to upgrade to this version, as the settings to enable Preventive GC have been removed
from JDK 21.

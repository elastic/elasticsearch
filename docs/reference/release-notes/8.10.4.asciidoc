=== Known issues

* Snapshot-based downgrades
+
The snapshot repository format changed in a manner that prevents earlier
versions of Elasticsearch from reading the repository contents if it contains
snapshots from this version and the last cluster to write to this repository was
in the 8.10 series. This will prevent you from reverting an upgrade to the 8.10
series by restoring a snapshot taken before the upgrade.
+
Snapshot repositories written by clusters running versions 8.11.0 and later are
compatible with all earlier versions. Moreover, clusters running version 8.11.0
or later will also automatically repair the repository format the first time
they write to the repository to take or delete a snapshot, making it so that all
earlier versions can read its contents again.
+
If you wish to downgrade to a version prior to 8.10.0, take or delete a snapshot
using a cluster running version 8.11.0 or later to repair the repository format
first. If you cannot repair the repository in this way, first delete all the
snapshots in the repository taken with version 8.10.0 or later using a cluster
running version 8.10.4.

* Searches involving nodes upgraded to 8.13.0 and a coordinator node that is running on version
  8.12 or earlier can produce duplicate buckets when running `date_histogram` or `histogram`
  aggregations. This can happen during a rolling upgrade to 8.13 or while running cross-cluster
  searches. (issue: {es-issue}108181[#108181]).

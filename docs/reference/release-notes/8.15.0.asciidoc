=== Known issues

* The `pytorch_inference` process used to run Machine Learning models can consume large amounts of memory.
In environments where the available memory is limited, the OS Out of Memory Killer will kill the `pytorch_inference`
process to reclaim memory. This can cause inference requests to fail.
Elasticsearch will automatically restart the `pytorch_inference` process
after it is killed up to four times in 24 hours. (issue: {es-issue}110530[#110530])

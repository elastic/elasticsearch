=== Known issues
* Elasticsearch will not start if custom role mappings are configured using the
`xpack.security.authc.realms.*.files.role_mapping` configuration option. As a workaround, custom role mappings
can be configured using the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-put-role-mapping.html[REST API] (issue: {es-issue}112503[#112503])

* ES|QL queries can lead to node crashes due to Out Of Memory errors when:
** Multiple indices match the query pattern
** These indices have many conflicting field mappings
** Many of those fields are included in the request
These issues deplete heap memory, increasing the likelihood of OOM errors. (issue: {es-issue}111964[#111964], {es-issue}111358[#111358]).
In Kibana, you might indirectly execute these queries when using Discover, or adding a Field Statistics panel to a dashboard.
+
To work around this issue, you have a number of options:
** Downgrade to an earlier version
** Upgrade to 8.15.2 upon release
** Follow the instructions to
<<esql-kibana-enable,disable ES|QL queries in {kib}>>
** Change the default data view in Discover to a smaller set of indices and/or one with fewer mapping conflicts.

* Index Stats, Node Stats and Cluster Stats API can return a null pointer exception if an index contains a `dense_vector` field
but there is an index segment that does not contain any documents with a dense vector field ({es-pull}112720[#112720]). Workarounds:
** If the affected index already contains documents with a dense vector field, force merge the index to a single segment.
** If the affected index does not already contain documents with a dense vector field, index a document with a dense vector field
and then force merge to a single segment.
** If the affected index's `dense_vector` fields are unused, reindex without the `dense_vector` fields.

* Synthetic source bug. Synthetic source may fail generating the _source at runtime, causing failures in get APIs or
partial failures in the search APIs. The result is that for the affected documents the _source can't be retrieved.
There is no workaround and the only option to is to upgrade to 8.15.2 when released.
+
If you use synthetic source then you may be affected by this bug if the following is true:
** If you have more fields then the `index.mapping.total_fields.limit` setting allows.
** If you use dynamic mappings and the `index.mapping.total_fields.ignore_dynamic_beyond_limit` setting is enabled.

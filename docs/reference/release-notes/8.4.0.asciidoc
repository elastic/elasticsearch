=== Known issues

// tag::ml-pre-7-datafeeds-known-issue[]
* {ml-cap} {dfeeds} cannot be listed if any are not modified since version 6.x
+
If you have a {dfeed} that was created in version 5.x or 6.x and has not
been updated since 7.0, it is not possible to list {dfeeds} in
8.4 and 8.5. This means that {anomaly-jobs} cannot be managed using
{kib}. This issue is fixed in 8.6.0.
+
If you upgrade to 8.4 or 8.5 with such a {dfeed}, you need to
work around the problem by updating each {dfeed}'s authorization information
using https://support.elastic.dev/knowledge/view/b5a879db[these steps].
// end::ml-pre-7-datafeeds-known-issue[]

// tag::file-based-settings-deadlock-known-issue[]
* Orchestrators which use a `settings.json` file to configure Elasticsearch may
encounter deadlocks during master elections (issue: {es-issue}92812[#92812])
+
To resolve the deadlock, remove the `settings.json` file and restart the
affected node.
// end::file-based-settings-deadlock-known-issue[]

include::8.0.0.asciidoc[tag=jackson-filtering-bug]

// tag::ingest-processor-log4j-cluster-instability-known-issue[]
* When the {ref}/attachment.html[ingest attachment processor] is used, the
interaction of https://tika.apache.org/[Tika] with log4j 2.18.0 and higher
(introduced in {es} 8.4.0) results in excessive logging. This logging is so
excessive that it can lead to cluster instability, to the point where the
cluster is unusable and nodes must be restarted. (issue: {es-issue}91964[#91964]).
This issue is fixed in {es} 8.7.0 ({es-pull}93878[#93878])
+
To resolve the issue, upgrade to 8.7.0 or higher.

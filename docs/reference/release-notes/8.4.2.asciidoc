=== Known issues

* **This version contains a regression in `multi_match` queries that use the
`cross_fields` scoring type.** {es}
+
When running a <<query-dsl-multi-match-query,`multi_match`>> query with the
`cross_fields` type, {es} can sometimes throw an IllegalArgument exception
with the message "totalTermFreq must be at least docFreq". If you use the
`cross_fields` scoring type, it is recommended that you skip version 8.4.2.
This regression was fixed in version 8.4.3.

* When using date range search with format that does not have all date fields (missing month or day)
an incorrectly parsed date could be used. The workaround is to use date pattern with all date fields (year, month, day)

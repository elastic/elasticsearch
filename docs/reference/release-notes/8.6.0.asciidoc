// tag::reconciliation-imbalance-known-issue[]
* Shard rebalancing may temporarily unbalance cluster
+
From 8.6.0 onwards the default shard rebalancing algorithm will compute the
final desired balance and then make shard movements to reconcile the current
state of the cluster with the desired state. However the order in which the
shard movements take place may be skewed towards certain nodes, causing the
cluster to become temporarily unbalanced while the reconciliation is ongoing.
As always, once a node reaches a disk watermark it will not accept any
additional shards, but this skew may result in nodes reaching their disk
watermarks more often than expected in normal operation. Once the
reconciliation process completes, the cluster will be balanced again.
+
To avoid this problem, upgrade to 8.8.0 or later.

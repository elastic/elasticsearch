=== Discover the structure of text files

experimental[] The new <<ml-find-file-structure,find file structure API>> 
determines the structure of a text file. It also returns statistics about the 
most common values of the detected fields and mappings that you can use when you 
ingest the file into {es}. If you want to influence the output, you can specify 
optional parameters. For example, if the file contains semi-structured text, you 
can specify a Grok pattern or let the tool generate it. This API is also used by 
the new File Data Visualizer in {kib}.

=== Improved {ml} results for partitioned multi-metric jobs

If you use the +partition_field_name+ parameter in a {ml} job (or the 
*Split Data* field in the {kib} multi-metric job wizard), it generates many 
simultaneous analyses that are modeled independently. In 6.5, we have decreased 
the influence of the anomaly scores in each partition on other partitions' scores. 
The overall effect of the change is to produce a much wider range of scores in 
partitioned multi-metric jobs.

beta[] You can now transform your data with
{stack-ov}/ml-dataframes.html[data frames]. There is a new {kib} wizard that
guides you through the process of creating a {dataframe-transform} to pivot and
summarize your data and store it in a new index. Alternatively, you can use
{ref}/data-frame-apis.html[{dataframe} APIs] to preview, create, and maintain
the transforms.

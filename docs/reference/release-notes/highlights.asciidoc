enable parallelizing search execution across segments that a single shard is made of.

[[add_new_int8_hsnw_index_type_for_int8_quantization_for_hnsw]]
=== Add new `int8_hsnw` index type for int8 quantization for HNSW
This commit adds a new index type called `int8_hnsw`. This index will
automatically quantized float32 values into int8 byte values. While
this increases disk usage by 25%, it reduces memory required for
fast HNSW search by 75%. Dramatically reducing the resource overhead
required for dense vector search.

[[data-tiers]]
=== Data Tier Formalization
7.10 introduces the concept of formalized data tiers within Elasticsearch. <<data-tiers,Data tiers>>
are a simple, integrated approach that hopes to give users control over optimizing for cost,
performance, and breadth/depth of data. Prior to this formalization, many users configured their own
tier topology using custom node attributes as well as using {ilm-init} to manage the lifecycle and
location of data within a cluster.

With this formalization, data tiers (content, hot, warm, and cold) can be explicitly configured
using <<node-roles,node roles>>, and indices can be configured to be allocated within a specific
tier using <<data-tier-shard-filtering,index-level data tier allocation filtering>>. {ilm-init} will
make use of these tiers to <<automatically ilm-migrate,migrate>> data between nodes as an index goes
through the phases of its lifecycle.

Newly created indices *not* part of a <<data-stream,data stream>> will be allocated to
`data_content` tier automatically, while indices abstracted by a data stream will be allocated to
the `data_hot` tier automatically. Nodes with the pre-existing `data` role are considered to be part
of all tiers.

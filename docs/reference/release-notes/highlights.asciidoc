[[add_new_experimental_rank_vectors_mapping_for_late_interaction_second_order_ranking]]
=== Add new experimental `rank_vectors` mapping for late-interaction second order ranking
Late-interaction models are powerful rerankers. While their size and overall cost doesn't lend itself for HNSW indexing, utilizing them as second order reranking can provide excellent boosts in relevance. The new `rank_vectors` mapping allows for rescoring over new and novel multi-vector late-interaction models like ColBERT or ColPali.

[[enable_lookup_join_in_non_snapshot_builds]]
=== Enable LOOKUP JOIN in non-snapshot builds
This effectively releases LOOKUP JOIN into tech preview. Docs will
follow in a separate PR.

- Enable the lexing/grammar for LOOKUP JOIN in non-snapshot builds.
- Remove the grammar for the unsupported `| JOIN ...` command (without `LOOKUP` as first keyword). The way the lexer modes work, otherwise we'd also have to enable `| JOIN ...` syntax on non-snapshot builds and would have to add additional validation to provide appropriate error messages.
- Remove grammar for `LOOKUP JOIN index AS ...` because qualifiers are not yet supported. Otherwise we'd have to put in additional validation as well to prevent such queries.

Also fix https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/121185

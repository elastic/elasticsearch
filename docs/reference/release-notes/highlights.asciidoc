=== EQL: `runs` keyword for repeated events

In 7.16, we added the `runs` keyword to EQL sequence queries. Sometimes you want
to find a sequence that contains an event multiple times in succession. Rather
than type the same event criteria multiple times, you can use a `runs` statement
to declare the criteria once and run it successively. For more details, check
out the {ref}/eql-syntax.html#eql-runs-keyword[EQL syntax documentation].

[[cross-cluster-eql-search]]
=== Cross-cluster EQL search

In 7.14, we added cross-cluster search support to EQL. Cross-cluster search lets
you run an EQL search across one or more remote clusters. See
{ref}/eql.html#run-eql-search-across-clusters[Run an EQL search across
clusters].

[[async-sql-search]]
=== Async SQL search

We've added support for async searches to {es-sql}. Searches across large data
sets or frozen data can take longer to return synchronous results. Async SQL
search lets you run these searches in the background instead. See
{ref}/sql-async.html[Run an async SQL search].

[[transform-top-metrics-support]]
=== Transforms: support for top metrics

{transforms-cap} are now able to support the
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-top-metrics.html[top metrics aggregation].
This improves performance when grouping by many fields. If these fields are
descriptive and have the same cardinality (for example, customer first and last
name describe their customer_id), then using top metrics significantly reduces
the work needed to be done by aggregations. It is also a usability improvement
if configuring top or last value, which previously would have required a
scripted metric.

[[ml-anomaly-detection-reset-job]]
=== {anomaly-detect-cap}: reset job API

The {ref}/ml-reset-job.html[reset job API] makes it easier to start
{anomaly-jobs} again from scratch, to put a job back to the state it was in
immediately after creation – equivalent to deleting it and recreating it, but
without the need to remember the configuration. It also simplifies support, as
users will be able to reset their job by a single click.

[discrete]
[[match-only-text]]
=== New `match_only_text` field type

{ref}/text.html#match-only-text-field-type[`match_only_text`] is a new
space-optimized variant of `text` that disables scoring and performs slower
on queries that need positions. It is best suited for indexing log messages.

[discrete]
[[composite-aggs-without-global-ordinals]]
=== More memory-efficient composite aggregations

Composite aggregations on `keyword` fields no longer use
{ref}/eager-global-ordinals.html[global ordinals], which for high cardinality
fields could use a lot of heap memory as part of the
{ref}/modules-fielddata.html[field data cache].

====
[[automatic-geoip-updates]]
=== Automatic databases updates for geoip processor

GeoIP processor uses Maxmind GeoLite2 databases to provide data
about the geographical location of IP addresses. This data changes frequently as IP addresses get reused.
In 7.14 we introduced a service that will automatically update these databases used so information is as accurate
as possible. It's enabled by default but its operation can be adjusted. See {ref}/geoip-processor.html[GeoIP processor]

[[esql_inlinestats]]
== ESQL: INLINESTATS
This adds the `INLINESTATS` command to ESQL which performs a STATS and
then enriches the results into the output stream. So, this query:

[source,esql]
----
FROM test
| INLINESTATS m=MAX(a * b) BY b
| WHERE m == a * b
| SORT a DESC, b DESC
| LIMIT 3
----

Produces output like:

|  a  |  b  |   m   |
| --- | --- | ----- |
|  99 | 999 | 98901 |
|  99 | 998 | 98802 |
|  99 | 997 | 98703 |

[[always_allow_rebalancing_by_default]]
== Always allow rebalancing by default
In earlier versions of {es} the `cluster.routing.allocation.allow_rebalance` setting defaults to
`indices_all_active` which blocks all rebalancing moves while the cluster is in `yellow` or `red` health. This was
appropriate for the legacy allocator which might do too many rebalancing moves otherwise. Today's allocator has
better support for rebalancing a cluster that is not in `green` health, and expects to be able to rebalance some
shards away from over-full nodes to avoid allocating shards to undesirable locations in the first place. From
version 8.16 `allow_rebalance` setting defaults to `always` unless the legacy allocator is explicitly enabled.

[[add_global_retention_in_data_stream_lifecycle]]
== Add global retention in data stream lifecycle
Data stream lifecycle now supports configuring retention on a cluster level,
namely global retention. Global retention \nallows us to configure two different
retentions:

- `data_streams.lifecycle.retention.default` is applied to all data streams managed
by the data stream lifecycle that do not have retention defined on the data stream level.
- `data_streams.lifecycle.retention.max` is applied to all data streams managed by the
data stream lifecycle and it allows any data stream \ndata to be deleted after the `max_retention` has passed.

[[enable_zstandard_compression_for_indices_with_index_codec_set_to_best_compression]]
== Enable ZStandard compression for indices with index.codec set to best_compression
Before DEFLATE compression was used to compress stored fields in indices with index.codec index setting set to
best_compression, with this change ZStandard is used as compression algorithm to stored fields for indices with
index.codec index setting set to best_compression. The usage ZStandard results in less storage usage with a
similar indexing throughput depending on what options are used. Experiments with indexing logs have shown that
ZStandard offers ~12% lower storage usage and a ~14% higher indexing throughput compared to DEFLATE.

=== Better space efficiency for `keyword`, `match_only_text`, and `text` fields

The inverted index switched to a new encoding that is more space-efficient.
This change will benefit `keyword` fields, `match_only_text` fields and, to a
lesser extent, `text` fields. On the dataset of application logs that the {es}
team uses for nightly benchmarks, this translated into a 14.4% reduction of the
size of the index of the `message` field (mapped as `match_only_text`) and an
overall 3.5% reduction of the on-disk footprint.

This change will be picked up automatically by both new indices, and existing
indices for every new segment.

=== Faster indexing of `geo_point`, `geo_shape` and range fields

Some optimizations have been made to indexing of multi-dimensional points,
which are used by `geo_point` fields, `geo_shape` fields and range fields.
Lucene-level benchmarks reported 10-15% faster indexing, so Elasticsearch
indices and data streams that mostly consist of these field types may observe a
non-negligible indexing speedup.

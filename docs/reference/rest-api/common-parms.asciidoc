Comma-separated list or wildcard expression
of actions used to limit the request.

Omit this parameter to return all actions.
--
end::actions[]

tag::active-only[]
`active_only`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`,
the response only includes ongoing shard recoveries.
Defaults to `false`.
end::active-only[]

tag::allow-no-indices[]
`allow_no_indices`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `false`, the request returns an error if any wildcard expression,
<<alias,index alias>>, or `_all` value targets only missing or closed indices.
This behavior applies even if the request targets other open indices. For
example, a request targeting `foo*,bar*` returns an error if an index starts
with `foo` but no index starts with `bar`.
end::allow-no-indices[]

tag::allow-no-match-transforms1[]
Specifies what to do when the request:
+
--
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are no {transforms} that match.
* Contains the `_all` string or no identifiers and there are no matches.
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are only partial matches.

The default value is `true`, which returns an empty `transforms` array when
there are no matches and the subset of results when there are partial matches.

If this parameter is `false`, the request returns a `404` status code when there
are no matches or only partial matches.
--
end::allow-no-match-transforms1[]

tag::allow-no-match-transforms2[]
Specifies what to do when the request:
+
--
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are no {transforms} that match.
* Contains the `_all` string or no identifiers and there are no matches.
* Contains wildcard expressions and there are only partial matches.

The default value is `true`, which returns a successful acknowledgement message
when there are no matches. When there are only partial matches, the API stops
the appropriate {transforms}. For example, if the request contains
`test-id1*,test-id2*` as the identifiers and there are no {transforms}
that match `test-id2*`, the API nonetheless stops the {transforms}
that match `test-id1*`.

If this parameter is `false`, the request returns a `404` status code when there
are no matches or only partial matches.

(Optional, string) Specific `tag` of the request for logging and statistical
purposes.
end::stats[]

tag::stored_fields[]
`stored_fields`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, retrieves the document fields stored in the
index rather than the document `_source`. Defaults to `false`.
end::stored_fields[]

tag::sync[]
Defines the properties {transforms} require to run continuously.
end::sync[]

tag::sync-time[]
Specifies that the {transform} uses a time field to synchronize the source and
destination indices.
end::sync-time[]

tag::sync-time-field[]
The date field that is used to identify new documents in the source.
end::sync-time-field[]

tag::sync-time-delay[]
The time delay between the current time and the latest input data time. The
default value is `60s`.
end::sync-time-delay[]

tag::transform-latest[]
The `latest` method transforms the data by finding the latest document for each
unique key.
end::transform-latest[]

tag::transform-retention[]
Defines a retention policy for the {transform}. Data that meets the defined
criteria is deleted from the destination index.
end::transform-retention[]

tag::transform-retention-time[]
Specifies that the {transform} uses a time field to set the retention policy.
end::transform-retention-time[]

tag::transform-retention-time-field[]
The date field that is used to calculate the age of the document.
end::transform-retention-time-field[]

tag::transform-retention-time-max-age[]
Specifies the maximum age of a document in the destination index. Documents that
are older than the configured value are removed from the destination index.
end::transform-retention-time-max-age[]

tag::transform-settings[]
Defines optional {transform} settings.
end::transform-settings[]

tag::transform-settings-dates-as-epoch-milli[]
Defines if dates in the output should be written as ISO formatted string (default)
or as millis since epoch. `epoch_millis` has been the default for transforms created
before version `7.11`. For compatible output set this to `true`.
The default value is `false`.
end::transform-settings-dates-as-epoch-milli[]

tag::transform-settings-docs-per-second[]
Specifies a limit on the number of input documents per second. This setting
throttles the {transform} by adding a wait time between search requests. The
default value is `null`, which disables throttling.
end::transform-settings-docs-per-second[]

tag::transform-settings-align-checkpoints[]
Specifies whether the transform checkpoint ranges should be optimized for performance.
Such optimization can align checkpoint ranges with date histogram interval when date histogram
is specified as a group source in the transform config. As an effect, less document updates in the
destination index will be performed thus improving overall performance.
The default value is `true`, which means the checkpoint ranges will be optimized if possible.
end::transform-settings-align-checkpoints[]

tag::transform-settings-max-page-search-size[]
Defines the initial page size to use for the composite aggregation for each
checkpoint. If circuit breaker exceptions occur, the page size is dynamically
adjusted to a lower value. The minimum value is `10` and the maximum is `65,536`.
The default value is `500`.
end::transform-settings-max-page-search-size[]

tag::transform-sort[]
Specifies the date field that is used to identify the latest documents.
end::transform-sort[]

tag::transform-unique-key[]
Specifies an array of one or more fields that are used to group the data.
end::transform-unique-key[]

tag::target-index[]
`<target-index>`::
+
--
(Required, string)
Name of the target index to create.

include::{es-repo-dir}/indices/create-index.asciidoc[tag=index-name-reqs]
--
end::target-index[]

tag::task-id[]
`<task_id>`::
(Optional, string) ID of the task to return
(`node_id:task_number`).
end::task-id[]

tag::term_statistics[]
`term_statistics`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, the response includes term frequency and document frequency.
Defaults to `false`.
end::term_statistics[]

tag::terminate_after[]
`terminate_after`::
(Optional, integer) Maximum number of documents to collect for each shard. If a
query reaches this limit, {es} terminates the query early. {es} collects
documents before sorting.
+
IMPORTANT: Use with caution. {es} applies this parameter to each shard handling
the request. When possible, let {es} perform early termination automatically.
Avoid specifying this parameter for requests that target data streams with
backing indices across multiple data tiers.
end::terminate_after[]

tag::time[]
`time`::
(Optional, <<time-units,time units>>)
Unit used to display time values.
end::time[]

tag::timeoutparms[]
tag::master-timeout[]
`master_timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>)
Period to wait for a connection to the master node. If no response is received
before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an error. Defaults to
`30s`.
end::master-timeout[]

tag::timeout[]
`timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>)
Period to wait for a response. If no response is received before the timeout
expires, the request fails and returns an error. Defaults to `30s`.
end::timeout[]
end::timeoutparms[]

tag::type[]
`<type>`::
(Optional, string)
Comma-separated list or wildcard expression of types
used to limit the request.
end::type[]

tag::transform-id[]
Identifier for the {transform}. This identifier can contain lowercase
alphanumeric characters (a-z and 0-9), hyphens, and underscores. It must start
and end with alphanumeric characters.
end::transform-id[]

tag::transform-id-wildcard[]
Identifier for the {transform}. It can be a {transform} identifier or a wildcard
expression. If you do not specify one of these options, the API returns
information for all {transforms}.
end::transform-id-wildcard[]

tag::trigger-count[]
The number of times the {transform} has been triggered by the scheduler. For
example, the scheduler triggers the {transform} indexer to check for updates
or ingest new data at an interval specified in the
<<put-transform-request-body,`frequency` property>>.
end::trigger-count[]

tag::cat-v[]
`v`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, the response includes column headings.
Defaults to `false`.
end::cat-v[]

tag::version[]
`version`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns the document version as part of a hit.
end::version[]

tag::doc-version[]
`version`::
(Optional, integer) Explicit version number for concurrency control.
The specified version must match the current version of the document for the
request to succeed.

Version of Lucene used to write the segment.

proceeding with the operation. Set to `all` or any positive integer up
to the total number of shards in the index (`number_of_replicas+1`).
Default: 1, the primary shard.

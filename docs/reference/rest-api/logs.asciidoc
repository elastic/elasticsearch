[[logs-api-prereqs]]
=== {api-prereq-title}
* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `create`
<<privileges-list-indices,index privileges>> for the target data stream.
* As the target stream depends on routing rules and the data provided in the log events,
it's recommended to grant permissions for `logs-*-*`.
* Automatic data stream creation requires a matching index template with data
stream enabled. See <<set-up-a-data-stream>>.

[[logs-api-desc]]
=== {api-description-title}

Provides a way to ingest log events into {es}, similar to the <<docs-bulk, Bulk API>>.

The log events are specified in the request body using a newline delimited JSON (NDJSON) structure.

The events are indexed into the `logs-<dataset>-<namespace>` <<data-streams, data stream>>,
according to the dataset and namespace parameters, which can be provided globally or on a per-event basis.

The endpoint is designed in a way that logs are never dropped, as long as the cluster has enough capacity.

If an error happens during ingestion,
the logs are sent to the `logs-dlq-<namespace>` data stream that acts as a dead letter queue for failed events.
However, log ingestion should rarely fail as the mappings in the built-in index template for the `logs-*-*` data streams are designed to minimize mapping conflicts.

A <<logs-api-request-body, couple of fields>> from the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] are indexed by default that are commonly used to search or filter logs.
All other fields are not indexed by default.
But you can still add any top-level fields and use them in searches and aggregations as the default index template for logs
<<dynamic-mapping-runtime-fields, maps dynamic fields as runtime fields>>.

For custom fields that are frequently used in searches or aggregations, you might want to leverage the speed benefits of indexing the field.
This comes at the expense of a larger index size and more processing at ingest time.
To index a custom field, <<create-index-template, create an index template>> for your dataset `logs-<dataset>-*` based on the built-in index template for `logs-*-*` and add your custom field to the mappings.
To immediately apply the setting, <<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream, roll over the data stream>>
This affects any new data added to the stream after the rollover.
However, it does not affect the data stream’s existing backing indices or existing data.

All fields, aside from the `@timestamp` field, are configured to <<ignore-malformed, ignore malformed>> values.
This means that if a log event contains a field whose type is incompatible with the type of the field that exists in the mapping,
{es} will ignore the field instead of rejecting the whole document.
For example, when a string is provided for a field that is mapped to integer.
Note that this currently doesn't apply for object/scalar mismatches, such as `"foo": "bar"` vs `"foo.bar": "baz"`.

[[logs-api-path-params]]
=== {api-path-parms-title}

{ecs-ref}/ecs-data_stream.html#field-data-stream-dataset[`data_stream.dataset`]::
  (Optional, string)
  Defaults to `generic`.
  Describes the ingested data and its structure.
  It is highly recommended to provide a value for this so that you can add structure to your logs after the fact.
  Example: `nginx.access`.

{ecs-ref}/ecs-data_stream.html#field-data-stream-namespace[`data_stream.namespace`]::
  (Optional, string)
  Defaults to `default`.
  A user-configurable arbitrary grouping, such as an environment (dev, prod, or qa), a team, or a strategic business unit.

[discrete]
[[logs-api-query-params]]
=== {api-query-parms-title}

Any provided query parameter will be added to each log line.
For example, `/_logs?service.name=myapp` will add `"service.name": "myapp"` to all logs.

[discrete]
[[logs-api-request-body]]
=== {api-request-body-title}
The request body contains a newline-delimited list of log events to ingest.
The individual events don't have any required fields and can contain arbitrary JSON content.
There is no required structure for the log events, and you can add any top-level fields.
However, it is recommended to follow the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] to structure your logs.

TIP: Use the {ecs-logging-ref}/intro.html[ECS logging libraries] to create ECS-compliant JSON logs.

Only the following fields, which are commonly used for searching, filtering, and correlating logs, are indexed by default:

* {ecs-ref}/ecs-base.html#field-timestamp[`@timestamp`] +
  If not provided, will be set to the current time.
  Can be provided as <<epoch-millis,`epoch_millis`>> or <<strict-date-time,`strict_date_optional_time`>> by default.
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-data_stream.html#field-data-stream-dataset[`data_stream.dataset`] +
  Overrides the `data_stream.dataset` <<logs-api-path-params, path parameter>> on a per-event basis.
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-data_stream.html#field-data-stream-namespace[`data_stream.namespace`] +
  Overrides the `data_stream.namespace` <<logs-api-path-params, path parameter>> on a per-event basis.
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-base.html#field-message[`message`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-log.html#field-log-level[`log.level`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-log.html#field-log-logger[`log.logger`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-service.html#field-service-name[`service.name`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-service.html#field-service-environment[`service.environment`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-service.html#field-service-version[`service.version`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-tracing.html#field-trace-id[`trace.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-tracing.html#field-transaction-id[`transaction.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-tracing.html#field-span-id[`span.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-process.html#field-process-pid[`process.pid`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-process.html#field-process-thread-name[`process.thread.name`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-error.html#field-error-type[`error.type`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-error.html#field-error-message[`error.message`]

* {ecs-ref}/ecs-cloud.html#field-cloud-availability-zone[`cloud.availability_zone`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-cloud.html#field-cloud-region[`cloud.region`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-host.html#field-host-hostname[`host.hostname`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-host.html#field-host-name[`host.name`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-container.html#field-container-id[`container.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-container.html#field-container-name[`container.name`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-orchestrator.html#field-orchestrator-namespace[`orchestrator.namespace`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-orchestrator.html#field-orchestrator-cluster-id[`orchestrator.cluster.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-orchestrator.html#field-orchestrator-cluster-name[`orchestrator.cluster.name`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-orchestrator.html#field-orchestrator-resource-id[`orchestrator.resource.id`]
* {ecs-ref}/ecs-orchestrator.html#field-orchestrator-resource-name[`orchestrator.resource.name`]

Dotted field names are expanded to objects so that they can be used interchangeably with nested objects. For example, the following documents are treated equally: `{"log.level": "INFO"}`, `{"log": { "level": "INFO"} }`.

`_metadata`::
(Optional, object)
Marks this line as a metadata line.
Provides metadata that will be merged into subsequent events.
If a metadata event is provided as the first line, the metadata is added to all logs events.
If a metadata event is provided after the first line, the metadata is added to all subsequent log events until another metadata event is provided.
This way you can easily add global metadata and send logs from multiple datasets in a single request, providing dataset-specific metadata.

[discrete]
[[logs-api-response-body]]
==== {api-response-body-title}

The log API's response body is always empty.

Status

* 202 Accepted: The log events have been received and are processed in the background. They should be searchable after a short while.
* 500 Internal Server Error: There was an error while processing the log events. Some logs may have been lost.

Ingests a single log into the `logs-myapp-default` data stream.

POST _logs/myapp?service.name=myapp <1>
{"@timestamp": 1463990734853, "message": "Hello", "custom": "value"} <2>

<1> Provides global metadata that applies to all log events in the request via query parameters.
<2> Specifies the timestamp in milliseconds since epoch.

After a short while the logs will become searchable.
Event though `custom_field` is not among the <<logs-api-request-body, list of fields that are indexed by default>>,
you can use it in searches and aggregations as it is mapped as a <<dynamic-mapping-runtime-fields, dynamic runtime field>>.

<1> Provides global metadata that applies to all log events in the request via a global metadata event.
<2> Provides local metadata that gets merged into all subsequent log lines until the next local metadata object is provided.
In this case, the metadata applies to the next event.
<3> This log event will have the following metadata:
`"service.name": "myapp"` (from the global metadata object) and
`"data_stream.dataset": "myapp"` (from the first local metadata object)

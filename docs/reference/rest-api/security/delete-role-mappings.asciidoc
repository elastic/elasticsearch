[[security-api-delete-role-mapping-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_security` cluster privilege.

[[security-api-delete-role-mapping-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Role mappings define which roles are assigned to each user. For more information, 
see <<mapping-roles>>.

The role mapping APIs are generally the preferred way to manage role mappings
rather than using <<mapping-roles-file,role mapping files>>.
The delete role mappings API cannot remove role mappings that are defined
in role mapping files.

[[security-api-delete-role-mapping-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`name`::
 (string) The distinct name that identifies the role mapping. The name is
  used solely as an identifier to facilitate interaction via the API; it does
  not affect the behavior of the mapping in any way.


[[security-api-delete-role-mapping-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example delete a role mapping:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE /_security/role_mapping/mapping1
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[setup:role_mapping]

If the mapping is successfully deleted, the request returns `{"found": true}`.
Otherwise, `found` is set to false.

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "found" : true
}
--------------------------------------------------

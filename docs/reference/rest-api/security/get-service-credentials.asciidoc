==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_security/service/<namespace>/<service>/credential`

[[security-api-get-service-credentials-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* To use this API, you must have at least the `read_security`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> (or a greater privilege
such as `manage_service_account` or `manage_security`).

[[security-api-get-service-credentials-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Use this API to retrieve a list of credentials for a service account.
The response includes service account tokens that were created with the
<<security-api-create-service-token,create service account tokens API>>
as well as file-backed tokens from all nodes of the cluster.

NOTE: For tokens backed by the `service_tokens` file, the API collects
them from all nodes of the cluster. Tokens with the same name from
different nodes are assumed to be the same token and are only counted once
towards the total number of service tokens.

==== {api-path-parms-title}

`namespace`::
(Required, string) Name of the namespace.

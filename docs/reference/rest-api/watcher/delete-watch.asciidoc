Removes a watch from {watcher}.

[[watcher-api-delete-watch-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`DELETE _watcher/watch/<watch_id>`

==== {api-prereq-title}

* You must have `manage_watcher` cluster privileges to use this API. For more
information, see <<security-privileges>>.

[[watcher-api-delete-watch-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

When the watch is removed, the document representing the watch in the `.watches`
index is gone and it will never be run again.

Please note that deleting a watch **does not** delete any watch execution records
related to this watch from the watch history.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a watch must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            watch directly from the `.watches` index using the Elasticsearch
            DELETE Document API. When {es} {security-features} are enabled, make
            sure no `write` privileges are granted to anyone over the `.watches`
            index.

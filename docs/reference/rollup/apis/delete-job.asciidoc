=== Delete Job API

<titleabbrev>Delete Job</titleabbrev>

experimental[]

This API deletes an existing rollup job.  A job must be *stopped* first before it can be deleted.  Attempting to delete
a started job will result in an error. Similarly, attempting to delete a nonexistent job will throw an exception.

.Deleting the job does not delete rolled up data
**********************************
When a job is deleted, that only removes the process that is actively monitoring and rolling up data.
It does not delete any previously rolled up data.  This is by design; a user may wish to roll up a static dataset.  Because
the dataset is static, once it has been fully rolled up there is no need to keep the indexing Rollup job around (as there
will be no new data).  So the job may be deleted, leaving behind the rolled up data for analysis.

If you wish to also remove the rollup data, and the rollup index only contains the data for a single job, you can simply
delete the whole rollup index.  If the rollup index stores data from several jobs, you must issue a Delete-By-Query that
targets the Rollup job's ID in the rollup index:


[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST my_rollup_index/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "_rollup.id": "the_rollup_job_id"
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

**********************************
==== Request

`DELETE _xpack/rollup/job/<job_id>`

//===== Description

==== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job


==== Request Body

There is no request body for the Delete Job API.

==== Authorization

You must have `manage` or `manage_rollup` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].


==== Examples

If we have a rollup job named `sensor`, it can be deleted with:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/rollup/job/sensor
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_rollup_job]

Which will return the response:

[source,js]
----
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE

If however we try to delete a job which doesn't exist:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/rollup/job/does_not_exist
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[catch:missing]

A 404 `resource_not_found` exception will be thrown:

[source,js]
----
{
    "error" : {
        "root_cause" : [
            {
                "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
                "reason" : "the task with id [does_not_exist] doesn't exist",
                "stack_trace": ...
            }
        ],
        "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
        "reason" : "the task with id [does_not_exist] doesn't exist",
        "stack_trace": ...
    },
    "status": 404
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"stack_trace": .../"stack_trace": $body.$_path/]

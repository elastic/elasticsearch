=== Get Rollup Jobs API
++++
<titleabbrev>Get Job</titleabbrev>
++++

experimental[]

This API returns the configuration, stats and status of rollup jobs.  The API can return the details for a single job,
or for all jobs.

Note: This API only returns active (both `STARTED` and `STOPPED`) jobs.  If a job was created, ran for a while then deleted,
this API will not return any details about that job.

For details about a historical job, the <<rollup-get-rollup-caps,Rollup Capabilities API>> may be more useful

==== Request

`GET _xpack/rollup/job/<job_id>`

//===== Description

==== Path Parameters

`job_id`::
  (string) Identifier for the job to retrieve.  If omitted (or `_all` is used) all jobs will be returned


==== Request Body

There is no request body for the Get Jobs API.

==== Authorization

You must have `monitor`, `monitor_rollup`, `manage` or `manage_rollup` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].

==== Examples

If we have already created a rollup job named `sensor`, the details about the job can be retrieved with:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _xpack/rollup/job/sensor
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_rollup_job]

Which will yield the following response:

// TESTRESPONSE

The `jobs` array contains a single job (`id: sensor`) since we requested a single job in the endpoint's URL.  The
details for this job contain three top-level parameters: `config`, `status` and `stats`

`config` holds the rollup job's configuration, which is identical to the configuration that was supplied when creating
the job via the <<rollup-put-job,Create Job API>>.

The `status` object holds the current status of the rollup job's indexer.  The possible values and their meanings are:

- `stopped` means the indexer is paused and will not process data, even if it's cron interval triggers
- `started` means the indexer is running, but not actively indexing data.  When the cron interval triggers, the job's
indexer will begin to process data
- `indexing` means the indexer is actively processing data and creating new rollup documents.  When in this state, any
subsequent cron interval triggers will be ignored because the job is already active with the prior trigger
- `abort` a transient state, which is usually not witnessed by the user.  The `abort` state is used if the task needs to
be shut down for some reason (job has been deleted, an unrecoverable error has been encountered, etc).  Shortly after
the `abort` state is set, the job will remove itself from the cluster

Finally, the `stats` object provides transient statistics about the rollup job, such as how many documents have been
processed and how many rollup summary docs have been indexed.  These stats are not persisted, so if a node is restarted
these stats will be reset.

If we add another job, we can see how multi-job responses are handled:

[source,js]

PUT _xpack/rollup/job/sensor2 <1>
{
    "index_pattern": "sensor-*",
    "rollup_index": "sensor_rollup",
    "cron": "*/30 * * * * ?",
    "page_size" :1000,
    "groups" : {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "timestamp",
        "interval": "1h",
        "delay": "7d"
      },
      "terms": {

      }
    },

            "metrics": ["min", "max", "sum"]
        },
        {
            "field": "voltage",
            "metrics": ["avg"]
        }
    ]
}

GET _xpack/rollup/job/_all <2>
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_rollup_job]
<1> We create a second job with name `sensor2`
<2> Then request all jobs by using `_all` in the GetJobs API

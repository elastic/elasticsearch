=== Stop Job API
++++
<titleabbrev>Stop Job</titleabbrev>
++++

experimental[]

This API stops an existing, started rollup job.  If the job does not exist an exception will be thrown.
Stopping an already stopped job has no action.

==== Request

`POST _xpack/rollup/job/<job_id>/_stop`

//===== Description

==== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

==== Query Parameters

`wait_for_completion` (optional)::
  (boolean) if set to true, causes the API to block until the indexer state completely stops.  If set to false, the
  API returns immediately and the indexer will be stopped asynchronously in the background.  Defaults to `false`.

`timeout` (optional)::
  (TimeValue) if `wait_for_completion=true`, the API will block for (at maximum)
  the specified duration while waiting for the job to stop. If more than `timeout` time has passed, the API
  will throw a timeout exception.  Note: even if a timeout exception is thrown, the stop request is still processing and
  will eventually move the job to `STOPPED`.  The timeout simply means the API call itself timed out while waiting
  for the status change.  Defaults to `30s`

==== Request Body

There is no request body for the Stop Job API.

==== Authorization

You must have `manage` or `manage_rollup` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].


==== Examples

If we have an already-started rollup job named `sensor`, it can be stopped with:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/rollup/job/sensor/_stop
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_started_rollup_job]

Which will return the response:

[source,js]
----
{
  "stopped": true
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE

If however we try to stop a job which doesn't exist:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/rollup/job/does_not_exist/_stop
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[catch:missing]

A 404 `resource_not_found` exception will be thrown:

[source,js]
----
{
    "error" : {
        "root_cause" : [
            {
                "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
                "reason" : "Task for Rollup Job [does_not_exist] not found",
                "stack_trace": ...
            }
        ],
        "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
        "reason" : "Task for Rollup Job [does_not_exist] not found",
        "stack_trace": ...
    },
    "status": 404
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"stack_trace": .../"stack_trace": $body.$_path/]

===== Waiting for the job to stop

Since only a stopped job can be deleted, it can be useful to block the StopJob API until the indexer has fully
stopped.  This is accomplished with the `wait_for_completion` query parameter, and optionally a `timeout`:


[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/rollup/job/sensor/_stop?wait_for_completion=true&timeout=10s
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_started_rollup_job]

The parameter will block the API call from returning until either the job has moved to `STOPPED`, or the specified
time has elapsed.  If the specified time elapses without the job moving to `STOPPED`, a timeout exception will be thrown.

If `wait_for_completion=true` is specified without a `timeout`, a default timeout of 30 seconds is used.

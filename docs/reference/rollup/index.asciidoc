== Rolling up historical data

experimental[]

NOTE: For version 8.5 and above we recommend <<downsampling,downsampling>> over
rollups as a way to reduce your storage costs for time series data.

Keeping historical data around for analysis is extremely useful but often avoided due to the financial cost of
archiving massive amounts of data. Retention periods are thus driven by financial realities rather than by the
usefulness of extensive historical data.

// tag::rollup-intro[]
The {stack} {rollup-features} provide a means to summarize and store historical
data so that it can still be used for analysis, but at a fraction of the storage
cost of raw data.

*DO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS*

The instructions on this page are for *local development only*. Do not use this configuration for production deployments, because it is not secure.
Refer to <<elasticsearch-intro-deploy, deployment options>> for a list of production deployment options.
====

Quickly set up {es} and {kib} in Docker for local development or testing, using the https://github.com/elastic/start-local?tab=readme-ov-file#-try-elasticsearch-and-kibana-locally[`start-local` script].

This setup comes with a one-month trial license that includes all Elastic features.
After the trial period, the license reverts to *Free and open - Basic*.

=== Run `start-local`

To set up {es} and {kib} locally, run the `start-local` script:

[source,sh]
----
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
----
// NOTCONSOLE
// REVIEWED[OCT.28.2024]

This script creates an `elastic-start-local` folder containing configuration files and starts both {es} and {kib} using Docker.

After running the script, you can access Elastic services at the following endpoints:

* *{es}*: http://localhost:9200
* *{kib}*: http://localhost:5601

The script generates a random password for the `elastic` user, and an API key, stored in the `.env` file.

[CAUTION]
====
This setup is for local testing only. HTTPS is disabled, and Basic authentication is used for {es}. For security, {es} and {kib} are accessible only through `localhost`.

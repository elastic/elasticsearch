# Similarity context [painless-similarity-context]

Use a Painless script to create a [similarity](/reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/similarity.md) equation for scoring documents in a query.

**Variables**

`weight` (`float`, read-only)
:   The weight as calculated by a [weight script](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-weight-context.md)

`query.boost` (`float`, read-only)
:   The boost value if provided by the query. If this is not provided the value is `1.0f`.

`field.docCount` (`long`, read-only)
:   The number of documents that have a value for the current field.

`field.sumDocFreq` (`long`, read-only)
:   The sum of all terms that exist for the current field. If this is not available the value is `-1`.

`field.sumTotalTermFreq` (`long`, read-only)
:   The sum of occurrences in the index for all the terms that exist in the current field. If this is not available the value is `-1`.

`term.docFreq` (`long`, read-only)
:   The number of documents that contain the current term in the index.

`term.totalTermFreq` (`long`, read-only)
:   The total occurrences of the current term in the index.

`doc.length` (`long`, read-only)
:   The number of tokens the current document has in the current field. This is decoded from the stored [norms](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/norms.md) and may be approximate for long fields

`doc.freq` (`long`, read-only)
:   The number of occurrences of the current term in the current document for the current field.

Note that the `query`, `field`, and `term` variables are also available to the [weight context](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-weight-context.md). They are more efficiently used there, as they are constant for all documents.

For queries that contain multiple terms, the script is called once for each term with that termâ€™s calculated weight, and the results are summed. Note that some terms might have a `doc.freq` value of `0` on a document, for example if a query uses synonyms.

**Return**

`double`
:   The similarity score for the current document.

**API**

The standard [Painless API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-api-reference-shared.html) is available.

With scripting, you can evaluate custom expressions in {es}. For example, you
can use a script to return a computed value as a field or evaluate a custom
score for a query.

The default scripting language is <<modules-scripting-painless,Painless>>.
Additional `lang` plugins are available to run scripts written in other
languages. You can specify the language of the script anywhere that scripts run.

Painless is purpose-built for {es}, can be used for any purpose in the
scripting APIs, and provides the most flexibility. The other languages are less
flexible, but can be useful for specific purposes.

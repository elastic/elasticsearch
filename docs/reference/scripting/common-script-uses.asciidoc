=== Common scripting use cases
You can write a script to do almost anything, and sometimes, that's
the trouble. It's challenging to know what's possible with scripts,
so the following examples address common uses cases where scripts are
really helpful.

[[scripting-field-extraction]]
==== Field extraction
The goal of this use case is simple; you have data with numerous
fields, but only want to extract one or a handful of them.

Let's start with a simple example by adding the `@timestamp` and `message`
fields to the `my-index` mapping as indexed fields. To remain flexible, use
`wildcard` as the field type for `message`:

[source,console]
----
PUT /my-index/
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "format": "strict_date_optional_time||epoch_second",
        "type": "date"
      },
      "message": {
        "type": "wildcard"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

After mapping the fields you want to retrieve, index a few records from
your log data into {es}. The following request uses the <<docs-bulk,bulk API>>
to index raw log data into `my-index`. Instead of indexing all of your log
data, you can use a small sample to experiment with runtime fields.

The final document is not a valid Apache log format, but we can account for
that scenario in our script.

[source,console]
----
POST /my-index/_bulk?refresh
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:30:17-05:00","message":"40.135.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:30:17 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 200 24736"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:30:53-05:00","message":"232.0.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:30:53 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 200 24736"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:31:12-05:00","message":"26.1.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:12 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 200 24736"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:31:19-05:00","message":"247.37.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:19 -0500] \"GET /french/splash_inet.html HTTP/1.0\" 200 3781"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:31:22-05:00","message":"247.37.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:22 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_nbg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 304 0"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:31:27-05:00","message":"252.0.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:27 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 200 24736"}
{"index":{}}
{"timestamp":"2020-04-30T14:31:28-05:00","message":"not a valid apache log"}

[[field-extraction-ip]]
===== Extract an IP address from a log message
If you want to retrieve results that include `clientip`, you can add that
field as a runtime field in the mapping. The following runtime script defines a
grok pattern that extracts structured fields out of a single text
field within a document. A grok pattern is like a regular expression that
supports aliased expressions that you can reuse. See <<grok-basics,Grok basics>> to learn more about grok syntax.

The script matches on the `%{COMMONAPACHELOG}` log pattern, which understands
the structure of Apache logs. If the pattern matches, the script emits the
value matching the IP address. If the pattern doesn't match
(`clientip != null`), the script just returns the field value without crashing.

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index/_mappings
{
  "runtime": {
    "http.clientip": {
      "type": "ip",
      "script": """
        String clientip=grok('%{COMMONAPACHELOG}').extract(doc["message"].value)?.clientip;
        if (clientip != null) emit(clientip); <1>
      """
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]
<1> This condition ensures that the script doesn't crash even if the pattern of
the message doesn't match.

You can define a simple query to run a search for a specific IP address and
return all related fields. Use the `fields` parameter of the search API to
retrieve the `http.clientip` runtime field.

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "http.clientip": "40.135.0.0"
    }
  },
  "fields" : ["http.clientip"]
}
----
// TEST[continued]
// TEST[s/_search/_search\?filter_path=hits/]

The response includes documents where the value for `http.clientip` matches
`40.135.0.0`.

  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,

    "hits" : [
      {

        },
        "fields" : {
          "http.clientip" : [
            "40.135.0.0"

      }

[[field-extraction-parse]]
==== Parse a string to extract part of a field
Regex is incredibly powerful but can be complicated. If you don't need the
power of regular expressions, you can use dissect patterns to match on fixed
delimiters to extract part of a field.

Instead of matching on a log pattern, you include the parts of the string that
you want to discard. Paying special attention to the parts of the string you
want to discard will help build successful dissect patterns.

For example, the log data at the start of this section includes a `message`
field. This string contains several pieces of data:

[source,js]
----
"message" : "247.37.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:22 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_nbg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 304 0"
----
// NOTCONSOLE

You can define a dissect pattern in a  runtime field to extract the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status[HTTP response code], which is
`304` in the previous example.

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index/_mappings
{
  "runtime": {
    "http.response": {
      "type": "long",
      "script": """
        String response=dissect('%{clientip} %{ident} %{auth} [%{@timestamp}] "%{verb} %{request} HTTP/%{httpversion}" %{response} %{size}').extract(doc["message"].value)?.response;
        if (response != null) emit(Integer.parseInt(response));
      """
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

You can then run a query to retrieve a specific HTTP response using the
`http.response` runtime field:

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "http.response": "304"
    }
  },
  "fields" : ["http.response"]
}
----
// TEST[continued]
// TEST[s/_search/_search\?filter_path=hits/]

The response includes a single document where the HTTP response is `304`:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "my-index",
        "_id" : "Sq-ex3gBA_A0V6dYGLQ7",
        "_score" : 1.0,
        "_source" : {
          "timestamp" : "2020-04-30T14:31:22-05:00",
          "message" : "247.37.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:22 -0500] \"GET /images/hm_nbg.jpg HTTP/1.0\" 304 0"
        },
        "fields" : {
          "http.response" : [
            304
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

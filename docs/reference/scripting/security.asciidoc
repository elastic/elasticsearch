== Scripting and security
Painless and {es} implement layers of security to build a defense in depth
strategy for running scripts safely.

Painless uses a fine-grained allowlist. Anything that is not part of the
allowlist results in a compilation error. This capability is the first layer of
security in a defense in depth strategy for scripting.

The second layer of security is the https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html[Java Security Manager]. As part of its startup
sequence, {es} enables the Java Security Manager to limit the actions that
portions of the code can take. <<modules-scripting-painless,Painless>> uses 
the Java Security Manager as an additional layer of defense to prevent scripts 
from doing things like writing files and listening to sockets.

{es} uses
{wikipedia}/Seccomp[seccomp] in Linux,
https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/osx-sandboxing-design[Seatbelt]
in macOS, and
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684147[ActiveProcessLimit]
on Windows as additional security layers to prevent {es} from forking or 
running other processes.

You can modify the following script settings to restrict the type of scripts
that are allowed to run, and control the available 
{painless}/painless-contexts.html[contexts] that scripts can run in. To
implement additional layers in your defense in depth strategy, follow the 
<<es-security-principles,{es} security principles>>.

[[allowed-script-types-setting]]

=== Allowed script types setting

{es} supports two script types: `inline` and `stored`. By default, {es} is 
configured to run both types of scripts. To limit what type of scripts are run, 
set `script.allowed_types` to `inline` or `stored`. To prevent any scripts from 
running, set `script.allowed_types` to `none`.

IMPORTANT: If you use {kib}, set `script.allowed_types` to `both` or `inline`.
Some {kib} features rely on inline scripts and do not function as expected
if {es} does not allow inline scripts.

For example, to run `inline` scripts but not `stored` scripts:

[source,yaml]
----
script.allowed_types: inline
----

[[allowed-script-contexts-setting]]
[discrete]
=== Allowed script contexts setting

By default, all script contexts are permitted. Use the `script.allowed_contexts`
setting to specify the contexts that are allowed. To specify that no contexts
are allowed, set `script.allowed_contexts` to `none`.

For example, to allow scripts to run only in `scoring` and `update` contexts:

[source,yaml]
----
script.allowed_contexts: score, update
----

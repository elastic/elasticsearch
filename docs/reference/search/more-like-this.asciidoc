[[search-more-like-this]]
== More Like This API

The more like this (mlt) API allows to get documents that are "like" a
specified document. Here is an example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1/_mlt?mlt_fields=tag,content&min_doc_freq=1'
--------------------------------------------------

The API simply results in executing a search request with
<<query-dsl-mlt-query,moreLikeThis>> query (http
parameters match the parameters to the `more_like_this` query). This
means that the body of the request can optionally include all the
request body options in the <<search-search,search
API>> (aggs, from/to and so on). Internally, the more like this
API is equivalent to performing a boolean query of `more_like_this_field`
queries, with one query per specified `mlt_fields`.

Rest parameters relating to search are also allowed, including
`search_type`, `search_indices`, `search_types`, `search_scroll`,
`search_size` and `search_from`.

When no `mlt_fields` are specified, all the fields of the document will
be used in the `more_like_this` query generated.

By default, the queried document is excluded from the response (`include`
set to false).

Note: In order to use the `mlt` feature a `mlt_field` needs to be either
be `stored`, store `term_vector` or `source` needs to be enabled.

==== From / Size

Pagination of results can be done by using the `from` and `size`
parameters. The `from` parameter defines the offset from the first
result you want to fetch. The `size` parameter allows you to configure
the maximum amount of hits to be returned.

Though `from` and `size` can be set as request parameters, they can also
be set within the search body. `from` defaults to `0`, and `size`
defaults to `10`.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_search
{
    "from" : 0, "size" : 10,
    "query" : {
        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE


Note that `from` + `size` can not be more than the `index.max_result_window`
index setting, which defaults to 10,000.

WARNING: {es} uses Lucene's internal doc IDs as tie-breakers. These internal
doc IDs can be completely different across replicas of the same
data. When paginating, you might occasionally see that documents with the same
sort values are not ordered consistently. For deep scrolling, it is more
efficient to use the <<request-body-search-scroll,Scroll>> or 
<<request-body-search-search-after,Search After>> APIs.

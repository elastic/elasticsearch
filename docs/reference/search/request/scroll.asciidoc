[[search-request-scroll]]
=== Scroll

While a `search` request returns a single ``page'' of results, the `scroll`
API can be used to retrieve large numbers of results (or even all results)
from a single search request, in much the same way as you would use a cursor
on a traditional database.

Scrolling is not intended for real time user requests, but rather for
processing large amounts of data, e.g. in order to reindex the contents of one
index into a new index with a different configuration.

NOTE: The results that are returned from a scroll request reflect the state of
the index at the time that the initial `search` request was  made, like a
snapshot in time. Subsequent changes to documents (index, update or delete)
will only affect later search requests.

In order to use scrolling, the initial search request should specify the
`scroll` parameter in the query string, which tells Elasticsearch how long it
should keep the ``search context'' alive (see <<scroll-search-context>>), eg `?scroll=1m`.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search?scroll=1m' -d '
{
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
'
--------------------------------------------------

The result from the above request includes a `scroll_id`, which should
be passed to the `scroll` API in order to retrieve the next batch of
results.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET <1> 'localhost:9200/_search/scroll?scroll=1m' <2> <3> \
     -d       'c2Nhbjs2OzM0NDg1ODpzRlBLc0FXNlNyNm5JWUc1' <4>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `GET` or `POST` can be used.
<2> The URL should not include the `index` or `type` name -- these
    are specified in the original `search` request instead.
<3> The `scroll` parameter tells Elasticsearch to keep the search context open
    for another `1m`.
<4> The `scroll_id` can be passed in the request body or in the
    query string as `?scroll_id=....`

Each call to the `scroll` API returns the next batch of results until there
are no more results left to return, ie the `hits` array is empty.

IMPORTANT: The initial search request and each subsequent scroll request
returns a new `scroll_id` -- only the most recent `scroll_id` should be
used.

==== Efficient scrolling with Scroll-Scan

Deep pagination with <<search-request-from-size,`from` and `size`>> -- e.g.
`?size=10&from=10000` -- is very inefficient as (in this example) 100,000
sorted results have to be retrieved from each shard and resorted in order to
return just 10 results.  This process has to be repeated for every page
requested.

added[1.2.0,Before 1.2.0, scrolling of sorted results was just as heavy as deep pagination]

The `scroll` API keeps track of which results have already been returned and
so is able to return sorted results more efficiently than with deep
pagination.  However, sorting results (which happens by default) still has a
cost.

Normally, you just want to retrieve all results and the order doesn't matter.
Scrolling can be combined with the <<scan,`scan`>> search type to disable
sorting and to return results in the most efficient way possible.  All that is
needed is to add `search_type=scan` to the query string of the initial search
request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
curl 'localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_search?scroll=1m&search_type=scan' <1> -d '
{
    "query": {
        "match" : {
            "title" : "elasticsearch"
        }
    }
}
'
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting `search_type` to `scan` disables sorting and makes scrolling
    very efficient.

A scanning scroll request differs from a standard scroll request in three
ways:

* Sorting is disabled. Results are returned in the order they appear in the index.
* The response of the initial `search` request will not contain any results in
  the `hits` array. The first results will be returned by the first `scroll`
  request.

* The <<search-request-from-size,`size` parameter>> controls the number of
  results *per shard*, not per request, so a `size` of `10` which hits 5
  shards will return a maximum of 50 results per `scroll` request.

[[scroll-search-context]]
==== Keeping the search context alive

The `scroll` parameter (passed to the `search` request and to every `scroll`
request) tells Elasticsearch how long it should keep the search context alive.
Its value (e.g. `1m`, see <<time-units>>) does not need to be long enough to
process all data -- it just needs to be long enough to process the previous
batch of results. Each `scroll` request (with the `scroll` parameter) sets a
new  expiry time.

Normally, the <<index-modules-merge,background merge process>> optimizes the
index by merging together smaller segments to create new bigger segments, at
which time the smaller segments are deleted. This process continues during
scrolling, but an open search context prevents the old segments from being
deleted while they are still in use.  This is how Elasticsearch is able to
return the results of the initial search request, regardless of subsequent
changes to documents.

TIP: Keeping older segments alive means that more file handles are needed.
Ensure that you have configured your nodes to have ample free file handles.
See <<file-descriptors>>.

You can check how many search contexts are open with the
<<cluster-nodes-stats,nodes stats API>>:

[source,js]
---------------------------------------
curl -XGET localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/indices/search?pretty
---------------------------------------

==== Clear scroll API

Search contexts are removed automatically either when all results have been
retrieved or when the `scroll` timeout has been exceeded.  However, you can
clear a search context manually with the `clear-scroll` API:

[source,js]
---------------------------------------
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_search/scroll \
     -d 'c2Nhbjs2OzM0NDg1ODpzRlBLc0FXNlNyNm5JWUc1' <1>
---------------------------------------
<1> The `scroll_id` can be passed in the request body or in the query string.

Multiple scroll IDs can be passed as comma separated values:

[source,js]
---------------------------------------
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_search/scroll \
     -d 'c2Nhbjs2OzM0NDg1ODpzRlBLc0FXNlNyNm5JWUc1,aGVuRmV0Y2g7NTsxOnkxaDZ' <1>
---------------------------------------

All search contexts can be cleared with the `_all` parameter:

[source,js]
---------------------------------------
curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/_search/scroll/_all
---------------------------------------

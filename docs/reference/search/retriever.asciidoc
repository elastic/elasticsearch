A retriever is a specification to describe top documents returned from a
search. A retriever replaces other elements of the <<search-search, search API>>
that also return top documents such as <<query-dsl, `query`>> and
<<search-api-knn, `knn`>>. A retriever may have child retrievers where a
retriever with two or more children is considered a compound retriever. This
allows for complex behavior to be depicted in a tree-like structure, called
the retriever tree, to better clarify the order of operations that occur
during a search.

[TIP]
====
Refer to <<retrievers-overview>> for a high level overview of the retrievers abstraction.
====

The following retrievers are available:

`standard`::
A <<standard-retriever, retriever>> that replaces the functionality of a traditional <<query-dsl, query>>.

`knn`::
A <<knn-retriever, retriever>> that replaces the functionality of a <<search-api-knn, knn search>>.

`rrf`::
A <<rrf-retriever, retriever>> that produces top documents from <<rrf, reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)>>.

`text_similarity_reranker`::
A <<text-similarity-reranker-retriever, retriever>> that enhances search results by re-ranking documents based on semantic similarity to a specified inference text, using a machine learning model.

[[standard-retriever]]
==== Standard Retriever

A standard retriever returns top documents from a traditional <<query-dsl, query>>.

===== Parameters:

`query`::
(Optional, <<query-dsl, query object>>)
+
Defines a query to retrieve a set of top documents.

`filter`::
(Optional, <<query-dsl, query object or list of query objects>>)
+
Applies a <<query-dsl-bool-query, boolean query filter>> to this retriever
where all documents must match this query but do not contribute to the score.

`search_after`::
(Optional, <<search-after, search after object>>)
+
Defines a search after object parameter used for pagination.

include::{es-ref-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=terminate_after]

`sort`::
+
(Optional, <<sort-search-results, sort object>>)
A sort object that that specifies the order of matching documents.

`min_score`::
(Optional, `float`)
+
Minimum <<relevance-scores, `_score`>> for matching documents. Documents with a
lower `_score` are not included in the top documents.

`collapse`::
(Optional, <<collapse-search-results, collapse object>>)
+
Collapses the top documents by a specified key into a single top document per key.

===== Restrictions

When a retriever tree contains a compound retriever (a retriever with two or more child
retrievers) *only* the query element is allowed.

[[rrf-retriever]]
==== RRF Retriever

An <<rrf, RRF>> retriever returns top documents based on the RRF formula
equally weighting two or more child retrievers.

===== Parameters

include::{es-ref-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=rrf-retrievers]

include::{es-ref-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=rrf-window-size]

===== Restrictions

An RRF retriever is a compound retriever. Child retrievers may not use
elements that are restricted by having a compound retriever as part of
the retriever tree.

    "retriever": {
        "rrf": {

[[text-similarity-reranker-retriever]]
==== Text Similarity Re-ranker Retriever

The `text_similarity_reranker` is a type of retriever that enhances search results by re-ranking documents based on semantic similarity to a specified inference text, using a machine learning model.

[TIP]
====
Refer to <<semantic-reranking>> for a high level overview of semantic reranking.
====

===== Prerequisites

To use `text_similarity_reranker` you must first set up a `rerank` task using the <<put-inference-api, Create {infer} API>>.
The `rerank` task should be set up with a machine learning model that can compute text similarity.

Currently you can:

* Integrate directly with the <<infer-service-cohere,Cohere Rerank inference endpoint>> using the `rerank` task type
* Integrate directly with the <<infer-service-google-vertex-ai,Google Vertex AI inference endpoint>> using the `rerank` task type
* Upload a model to {es} with {eland-docs}/machine-learning.html#ml-nlp-pytorch[Eland]
** Then set up an <<inference-example-eland,{es} service inference endpoint>> with the `rerank` task type

===== Parameters

`field`::
(Required, `string`)
+
The document field to be used for text similarity comparisons. This field should contain the text that will be evaluated against the `inferenceText`.

`inference_id`::
(Required, `string`)
+
Unique identifier of the inference endpoint created using the {infer} API.

`inference_text`::
(Required, `string`)
+
The text snippet used as the basis for similarity comparison.

`rank_window_size`::
(Optional, `int`)
+
The number of top documents to consider in the re-ranking process. Defaults to `10`.

`min_score`::
(Optional, `float`)
+
Sets a minimum threshold score for including documents in the re-ranked results. Documents with similarity scores below this threshold will be excluded. Note that score calculations vary depending on the model used.

===== Restrictions

A text similarity re-ranker retriever is a compound retriever. Child retrievers may not use elements that are restricted by having a compound retriever as part of the retriever tree.

===== Example

[source,js]
----
GET /index/_search
{
    "retriever": {
        "text_similarity_reranker": {
            "retriever": {
                "standard": { ... }
            },
            "field": "text",
            "inference_id": "my-cohere-rerank-model",
            "inference_text": "Most famous landmark in Paris",
            "rank_window_size": 100,
            "min_score": 0.5
        }
    }

==== Using `from` and `size` with a retriever tree

The <<search-from-param, `from`>> and <<search-size-param, `size`>>
parameters are provided globally as part of the general
<<search-search, search API>>. They are applied to all retrievers in a
retriever tree unless a specific retriever overrides the `size` parameter
using a different parameter such as `rank_window_size`. Though, the final
search hits are always limited to `size`.

==== Using aggregations with a retriever tree

<<search-aggregations, Aggregations>> are globally specified as part of a search request.
The query used for an aggregation is the combination of all leaf retrievers as `should`
clauses in a <<query-dsl-bool-query, boolean query>>.

==== Restrictions on search parameters when specifying a retriever

When a retriever is specified as part of a search the following elements are not allowed
at the top-level and instead are only allowed as elements of specific retrievers:

* <<request-body-search-query, `query`>>
* <<search-api-knn, `knn`>>
* <<search-after, `search_after`>>
* <<request-body-search-terminate-after, `terminate_after`>>
* <<search-sort-param, `sort`>>
* <<rescore, `rescore`>>
* <<search-api-min-score, `min_score`>>

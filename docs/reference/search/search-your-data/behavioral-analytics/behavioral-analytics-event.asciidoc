==== Discover and Lens

For more detailed analysis, you can view events in the Kibana {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover^] app.
The Behavioral Analytics UI will guide you here from the *Explorer* dashboard.
You can dig into the details using Discover and then generate visualizations using {kibana-ref}/lens.html[Lens^].

Discover works with {kibana-ref}/data-views.html[data views^].
You'll find a data view automatically created for your collection, named `behavioral_analytics.events-<your-collection>`.
This data view will be pre-selected in the data view dropdown menu.
Use this menu to switch between data views for different collections.

The following screenshot shows you where to find the data view dropdown menu in Discover:

Discover has a lot of options, but here's a quick overview of how to get started:

* Filter your data by searching for terms, such as `search`, `page_view`, and `search_click`.
You'll see a time series of hits that match your search.
* Search for "event" in the field name search bar.
For example:
** Select `event.action`.
You'll find a list of all the events you've sent and their frequency distribution.
* Search for `search.query` to find all search queries.
* Select *Visualize* to create a Lens visualization.

The following screenshot shows a Lens visualization of an `event.action` distribution:

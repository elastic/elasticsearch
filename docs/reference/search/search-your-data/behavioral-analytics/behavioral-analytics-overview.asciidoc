== Search analytics

Behavioral Analytics is an analytics event collection platform.
Use these tools to analyze your users' searching and clicking behavior.
Leverage this information to improve the relevance of your search results and identify gaps in your content.

<<behavioral-analytics-start, Get started>> by embedding one of our JavaScript clients on your website or application and instrumenting the user actions you want to track.
For example, you can track when a user searches, when they click on a search result, or when a user visits a particular page on your website.

Data and analytics are stored in {es} indices, for advanced analysis and visualization.

Even if you don't use Elastic for search, you can use these tools to collect analytics from your application/website.

.GDPR compliance
====

Users may be concerned about the privacy implications of analytics data collection.
Behavioral Analytics is fully GDPR compliant, because no personal data are collected.

To integrate the behavioral analytics client, session data are stored in two tokens:

* *User Token*. A unique identifier for the user.
Stored under `EA_UID` cookie. Default time length is 24 hours from the first time the user visits the site.

* *Session Token*. A unique identifier for the session.
Stored under `EA_SID` cookie. Time length is 30 minutes from the last time the user visits the site.

These tokens enable the client to identify a user across sessions.
They do not collect sensitive information, such as IP addresses or location data, or any other personal data.

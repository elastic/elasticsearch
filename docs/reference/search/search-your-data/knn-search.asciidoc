//tag::knn-def[]
A _k-nearest neighbor_ (kNN) search finds the _k_ nearest vectors to a query
vector, as measured by a similarity metric.
//end::knn-def[]

Common use cases for kNN include:

* Relevance ranking based on natural language processing (NLP) algorithms
* Product recommendations and recommendation engines
* Similarity search for images or videos

[[knn-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

* To run a kNN search, you must be able to convert your data into meaningful
vector values. You create these vectors outside of {es} and add them to
documents as <<dense-vector,`dense_vector`>> field values. Queries are
represented as vectors with the same dimension.
+
Design your vectors so that the closer a document's vector is to a query vector,
based on a similarity metric, the better its match.

* To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the following
<<privileges-list-indices,index privileges>>:

** `create_index` or `manage` to create an index with a `dense_vector` field
** `create`, `index`, or `write` to add data to the index you created
** `read` to search the index

[[knn-methods]]
=== kNN methods

{es} supports two methods for kNN search:

* experimental:[] <<approximate-knn,Approximate kNN>> using the kNN search API

* <<exact-knn,Exact, brute-force kNN>> using a `script_score` query with a
vector function

In most cases, you'll want to use approximate kNN. Approximate kNN offers lower
latency at the cost of slower indexing and imperfect accuracy.

Exact, brute-force kNN guarantees accurate results but doesn't scale well with
large datasets. With this approach, a `script_score` query must scan each
matching document to compute the vector function, which can result in slow
search speeds. However, you can improve latency by using a <<query-dsl,query>>
to limit the number of matching documents passed to the function. If you
filter your data to a small subset of documents, you can get good search
performance using this approach.

[[approximate-knn]]
=== Approximate kNN

experimental::[]

To run an approximate kNN search, use the kNN search API to search a
`dense_vector` field with indexing enabled.

. Explicitly map one or more `dense_vector` fields. Approximate kNN search
requires the following mapping options:
+
--
* An `index` value of `true`.

* A `similarity` value. This value determines the similarity metric used to
score documents based on similarity between the query and document vector. For a
list of available metrics, see the <<dense-vector-similarity,`similarity`>>
parameter documentation.

NOTE: Support for approximate kNN search was added in version 8.0. Before
this, `dense_vector` fields did not support enabling `index` in the mapping.
If you created an index prior to 8.0 containing `dense_vector` fields, then to
support approximate kNN search the data must be reindexed using a new field
mapping that sets `index: true`.

[[tune-approximate-knn-for-speed-accuracy]]
==== Tune approximate kNN for speed or accuracy

To gather results, the kNN search API finds a `num_candidates` number of
approximate nearest neighbor candidates on each shard. The search computes the
similarity of these candidate vectors to the query vector, selecting the `k`
most similar results from each shard. The search then merges the results from
each shard to return the global top `k` nearest neighbors.

You can increase `num_candidates` for more accurate results at the cost of
slower search speeds. A search with a high value for `num_candidates`
considers more candidates from each shard. This takes more time, but the
search has a higher probability of finding the true `k` top nearest neighbors.

Similarly, you can decrease `num_candidates` for faster searches with
potentially less accurate results.

[discrete]
[[knn-indexing-considerations]]
==== Indexing considerations

{es} shards are composed of segments, which are internal storage elements in the
index. For approximate kNN search, {es} stores the dense vector values of each
segment as an https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320[HNSW graph]. Indexing vectors for
approximate kNN search can take substantial time because of how expensive it is
to build these graphs. You may need to increase the client request timeout for
index and bulk requests.

<<indices-forcemerge,Force merging>> the index to a single segment can improve
kNN search latency. With only one segment, the search needs to check a single,
all-inclusive HNSW graph. When there are multiple segments, kNN search must
check several smaller HNSW graphs as it searches each segment after another.
You should only force merge an index if it is no longer being written to.

[discrete]
[[approximate-knn-limitations]]
==== Limitations for approximate kNN search

* You can't run an approximate kNN search on a <<filter-alias,filtered alias>>.

* You can't run an approximate kNN search on a `dense_vector` field within a
<<nested,`nested`>> mapping.

[[exact-knn]]
=== Exact kNN

To run an exact kNN search, use a `script_score` query with a vector function.

. Explicitly map one or more `dense_vector` fields. If you don't intend to use
the field for approximate kNN, omit the `index` mapping option or set it to
`false`. This can significantly improve indexing speed.

. Use the <<search-search,search API>> to run a `script_score` query containing
a <<vector-functions,vector function>>.
+
TIP: To limit the number of matched documents passed to the vector function, we
recommend you specify a filter query in the `script_score.query` parameter. If
needed, you can use a <<query-dsl-match-all-query,`match_all` query>> in this
parameter to match all documents. However, matching all documents can
significantly increase search latency.

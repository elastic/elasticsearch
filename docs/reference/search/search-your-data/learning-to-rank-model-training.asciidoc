==== Train and deploy a model using Eland

Typically, the https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[XGBoost^] model training process uses standard Python data science tools like Pandas and scikit-learn.


We have developed an
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/search/08-learning-to-rank.ipynb[example
notebook^] available in the `elasticsearch-labs` repo. This interactive Python notebook
details an end-to-end model training and deployment workflow.

We highly recommend using https://eland.readthedocs.io/[eland^] in your workflow, because it provides important functionalities for working with LTR in {es}. Use eland to:

* Configure feature extraction

* Extract features for training

* Deploy the model in {es}

[[learning-to-rank-model-training-feature-definition]]
===== Configure feature extraction in Eland

Feature extractors are defined using templated queries. https://eland.readthedocs.io/[Eland^] provides the `eland.ml.ltr.QueryFeatureExtractor` to define these feature extractors directly in Python:

[source,python]
----
from eland.ml.ltr import QueryFeatureExtractor

feature_extractors=[
    # We want to use the score of the match query for the title field as a feature:
    QueryFeatureExtractor(
        feature_name="title_bm25",
        query={"match": {"title": "{{query}}"}}
    ),
    # We can use a script_score query to get the value
    # of the field rating directly as a feature:
    QueryFeatureExtractor(
        feature_name="popularity",
        query={
            "script_score": {
                "query": {"exists": {"field": "popularity"}},
                "script": {"source": "return doc['popularity'].value;"},
            }
        },
    ),
    # We can execute a script on the value of the query
    # and use the return value as a feature:
    QueryFeatureExtractor(
        feature_name="query_length",
        query={
            "script_score": {
                "query": {"match_all": {}},
                "script": {
                    "source": "return params['query'].splitOnToken(' ').length;",
                    "params": {
                        "query": "{{query}}",
                    }
                },
            }
        },
    ),
]

// NOTCONSOLE

Once the feature extractors have been defined, they are wrapped in an `eland.ml.ltr.LTRModelConfig` object for use in later training steps:

[source,python]
----
from eland.ml.ltr import LTRModelConfig

ltr_config = LTRModelConfig(feature_extractors)
----
// NOTCONSOLE

[discrete]
[[learning-to-rank-model-training-feature-extraction]]
===== Extracting features for training

Building your dataset is a critical step in the training process. This involves
extracting relevant features and adding them to your judgment list. We
recommend using Eland's `eland.ml.ltr.FeatureLogger` helper class for this
process.

[source,python]
----
from eland.ml.ltr import FeatureLogger

# Create a feature logger that will be used to query {es} to retrieve the features:
feature_logger = FeatureLogger(es_client, MOVIE_INDEX, ltr_config)
----
// NOTCONSOLE

The FeatureLogger provides an `extract_features` method which enables you to extract features for a list of specific documents from your judgment list. At the same time, you can pass query parameters to the feature extractors defined earlier:

[source,python]
----
feature_logger.extract_features(
    query_params={"query": "foo"},
    doc_ids=["doc-1", "doc-2"]
)
----
// NOTCONSOLE

Our https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/search/08-learning-to-rank.ipynb[example notebook^] explains how to use the `FeatureLogger` to build a training dataset, by adding features to a judgment list.

[[learning-to-rank-model-training-feature-extraction-notes]]
====== Notes on feature extraction

* We strongly advise against implementing feature extraction on your own. It's crucial to maintain consistency in feature extraction between the training environment and inference in {es}. By using eland tooling, which is developed and tested in tandem with {es}, you can ensure that they function together consistently.

* Feature extraction is performed by executing queries on the {es} server. This could put a lot of stress on your cluster, especially when your judgment list contains a lot of examples or you have many features. Our feature logger implementation is designed to minimize the number of search requests sent to the server and reduce load. However, it might be best to build your training dataset using an {es} cluster that is isolated from any user-facing, production traffic.

[discrete]
[[learning-to-rank-model-deployment]]
===== Deploy your model into {es}

Once your model is trained you will be able to deploy it in your {es} cluster. You can use Eland's `MLModel.import_ltr_model method`:

[source,python]
----
from eland.ml import MLModel

LEARNING_TO_RANK_MODEL_ID="ltr-model-xgboost"

MLModel.import_ltr_model(
    es_client=es_client,
    model=ranker,
    model_id=LEARNING_TO_RANK_MODEL_ID,
    ltr_model_config=ltr_config,
    es_if_exists="replace",
)
----
// NOTCONSOLE

This method will serialize the trained model and the Learning To Rank configuration (including feature extraction) in a format that {es} can understand. The model is then deployed to {es} using the <<put-trained-models, Create Trained Models API>>.

The following types of models are currently supported for LTR with {es}:

* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html[`DecisionTreeRegressor`^]
* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html[`RandomForestRegressor`^]
* https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.html[`LGBMRegressor`^]
* https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#xgboost.XGBRanker[`XGBRanker`^]
* https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#xgboost.XGBRegressor[`XGBRegressor`^]


More model types will be supported in the future.

[[learning-to-rank-model-management]]
==== Learning To Rank model management

Once your model is deployed in {es} you can manage it using the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-df-trained-models-apis.html[trained model APIs].
You're now ready to work with your LTR model as a rescorer at <<learning-to-rank-search-usage, search time>>.

_Search Applications_ enable users to build search-powered applications that leverage the full power of {es} and its Query DSL, with a simplified user experience.
Create search applications based on your {es} indices, build queries using search templates, and easily preview your results directly in the {kib} Search UI.

You can also interact with your search applications using the <<search-application-apis>>.
Search Applications are designed to simplify building unified search experiences across a range of enterprise search use cases, using the Elastic platform.

.Search Applications documentation
****
Documentation for the Search Applications feature lives in two places:

* The documentation in this section covers the basics of Search Applications, information about working with Search Applications in the {kib} UI, and use case examples.
* The <<search-application-apis,{es} API documentation>> contains the API references for working with Search Applications programmatically.
Jump there if you're only interested in the APIs.

[[search-application-overview-prerequisites]]
=== Availability and prerequisites

The Search Applications feature was introduced in Elastic version *8.8.0*.

[NOTE]
====
Search Applications is a beta feature.
Beta features are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of general release (GA) features.
Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.
====

This feature is available to all *Elastic Cloud* deployments.

This feature is also available to *self-managed* deployments when Elastic subscription requirements are satisfied.
View the requirements for this feature under the *Elastic Search* section of the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic Stack subscriptions^] page.

Your deployment must include the {es} and {kib} services.

Managing search applications requires the `manage_search_application` cluster privilege, and also requires the `manage` <<privileges-list-indices,index privilege>> on all indices associated with the search application.

[[search-application-overview-summary]]
=== Overview

The {es} <<query-dsl,Query DSL>> is powerful and flexible, but it comes with a steep learning curve.
Complex queries are verbose and hard to understand for non-experts.
We've designed search applications to be easier to search over, but with the flexibility of working with an {es} index.

Search Applications use <<search-template,search templates>> to simplify the process of building queries.
Templates are defined when creating a search application, and can be customized according to your needs.
Read <<search-application-api>> for the details.

=== Get started

[[search-application-overview-get-started-ui]]
==== Option 1: Get started in the UI

You can create build, and manage your search applications directly in the {kib} UI under *Search*.
Make sure you have at least one {es} index to work with on your deployment.
The indices underlying your search application are searched together, similar to how an <<aliases,alias>> searches over multiple indices.

To create a new search application in {kib}:

. Go to *Search > Search Applications*.
. Select *Create*.
. Select the {es} indices you want to use for your search application.
. Name your search application.
. Select *Create*.

Your search application should now be available in the list of search applications.

Once created, you can explore the documents in your search application under *Search > Search Applications >* _your-search-application_ > *Docs Explorer*.
From there, you can expand a matching {es} document to see its full contents.

[[search-application-overview-get-started-api]]
==== Option 2: Get started with the API

Use the {es} <<put-search-application,Put Search Application API>> to create a search application.


The following example creates a search application named `my_search_application` that searches over the `my_search_index1` and `my_search_index2` indices, along with defining a simple search template (Refer to <<search-application-api-default-template>>).

[source,console]
----
PUT /_application/search_application/my_search_application
{
  "indices": [ "my_search_index1", "my_search_index2" ],
  "template": {
    "script": {
      "source": {
        "query": {
          "query_string": {
            "query": "{{query_string}}",
            "default_field": "{{default_field}}"
          }
        }
      },
      "params": {
        "query_string": "*",
        "default_field": "*"
      }
    }
  }
}

[[search-application-overview-get-started-templates]]
==== Search templates

Search templates are the heart of your search applications.
The <<search-application-api-default-template,default template>> created for a search application is very minimal, and you'll want to customize it to suit your needs.
<<search-application-api>> contains a number of examples to get you started, including the default template, as well as templates for text search, semantic search and hybrid search.

[[search-query]]
A _search query_, or _query_, is a request for information about data in
{es} data streams or indices.

You can think of a query as a question, written in a way {es} understands.
Depending on your data, you can use a query to get answers to questions like:

* What processes on my server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
* What users on my network ran `regsvr32.exe` within the last week?
* What pages on my website contain a specific word or phrase?

{es} supports several search methods:

Search for exact values::
Search for <<term-level-queries,exact values or ranges>> of numbers, dates, IPs,
or strings.

Full-text search::
Use <<full-text-queries,full text queries>> to query <<analysis,unstructured
textual data>> and find documents that best match query terms.

Vector search:: Store vectors in {es} and use <<knn-search,approximate nearest
neighbor (ANN) or k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search>> to find vectors that are
similar, supporting use cases like <<semantic-search,semantic search>>.

=== Run a search

To run a search request, you can use the search API or Search Applications.

<<search-your-data,Search API>>::
The <<search-search,search API>> enables you to search and
<<search-aggregations,aggregate>> data stored in {es} using a query language
called the <<query-dsl,Query DSL>>.

<<search-application-overview,Search Applications>>::
Search Applications enable you to leverage the full power of {es} and its Query
DSL, with a simplified user experience. Create search applications based on your
{es} indices, build queries using search templates, and easily preview your
results directly in the Kibana Search UI.

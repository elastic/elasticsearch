=== Tutorial: semantic search with ELSER
++++
<titleabbrev>Semantic search with ELSER</titleabbrev>
++++

Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR - or ELSER - is an NLP model trained by Elastic
that enables you to perform semantic search by using sparse vector
representation. Instead of literal matching on search terms, semantic search
retrieves results based on the intent and the contextual meaning of a search
query.

The instructions in this tutorial shows you how to use ELSER to perform semantic
search on your data.

NOTE: Only the first 512 extracted tokens per field are considered during
semantic search with ELSER. Refer to
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-limitations.html#ml-nlp-elser-v1-limit-512[this page] for more
information.

[[requirements]]
==== Requirements

To perform semantic search by using ELSER, you must have the NLP model deployed
in your cluster. Refer to the
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-elser.html[ELSER documentation] to learn how to download and
deploy the model.

NOTE: The minimum dedicated ML node size for deploying and using the ELSER model
is 4 GB in Elasticsearch Service if
{cloud}/ec-autoscaling.html[deployment autoscaling] is turned off. Turning on
autoscaling is recommended because it allows your deployment to dynamically
adjust resources based on demand. Better performance can be achieved by using
more allocations or more threads per allocation, which requires bigger ML nodes.
Autoscaling provides bigger nodes when required. If autoscaling is turned off,
you must provide suitably sized nodes yourself.

[[elser-mappings]]
==== Create the index mapping

First, the mapping of the destination index - the index that contains the tokens
that the model created based on your text - must be created.  The destination
index must have a field with the
<<sparse-vector, `sparse_vector`>> or <<rank-features,`rank_features`>> field
type to index the ELSER output.

NOTE: ELSER output must be ingested into a field with the `sparse_vector` or
`rank_features` field type. Otherwise, {es} interprets the token-weight pairs as
a massive amount of fields in a document. If you get an error similar to this
`"Limit of total fields [1000] has been exceeded while adding new fields"` then
the ELSER output field is not mapped properly and it has a field type different
than `sparse_vector` or `rank_features`.

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "content_embedding": { <1>
        "type": "sparse_vector" <2>
      },
      "content": { <3>
        "type": "text" <4>
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The name of the field to contain the generated tokens. It must be refrenced
in the {infer} pipeline configuration in the next step.
<2> The field to contain the tokens is a `sparse_vector` field.
<3> The name of the field from which to create the sparse vector representation.
In this example, the name of the field is `content`. It must be referenced in the
{infer} pipeline configuration in the next step.
<4> The field type which is text in this example.

[[inference-ingest-pipeline]]
==== Create an ingest pipeline with an inference processor

Create an <<ingest,ingest pipeline>> with an
<<inference-processor,{infer} processor>> to use ELSER to infer against the data
that is being ingested in the pipeline.

[source,console]
----
PUT _ingest/pipeline/elser-v2-test
{
  "processors": [
    {
      "inference": {
        "model_id": ".elser_model_2",
        "input_output": [ <1>
          {
            "input_field": "content",
            "output_field": "content_embedding"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> Configuration object that defines the `input_field` for the {infer} process
and the `output_field` that will contain the {infer} results.

[source,console]

[[load-data]]
==== Load data

In this step, you load the data that you later use in the {infer} ingest
pipeline to extract tokens from it.

Use the `msmarco-passagetest2019-top1000` data set, which is a subset of the MS
MARCO Passage Ranking data set. It consists of 200 queries, each accompanied by
a list of relevant text passages. All unique passages, along with their IDs,
have been extracted from that data set and compiled into a
https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/blob/main/docs/en/stack/ml/nlp/data/msmarco-passagetest2019-unique.tsv[tsv file].

Download the file and upload it to your cluster using the
{kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana[Data Visualizer]
in the {ml-app} UI. Assign the name `id` to the first column and `content` to
the second column. The index name is `test-data`. Once the upload is complete,
you can see an index named `test-data` with 182469 documents.


[discrete]
[[reindexing-data-elser]]
==== Ingest the data through the {infer} ingest pipeline

Create the tokens from the text by reindexing the data throught the {infer}
pipeline that uses ELSER as the inference model.

[source,console]
----
POST _reindex?wait_for_completion=false
{
  "source": {
    "index": "test-data",
    "size": 50 <1>
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "my-index",
    "pipeline": "elser-v2-test"
  }
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The default batch size for reindexing is 1000. Reducing `size` to a smaller
number makes the update of the reindexing process quicker which enables you to
follow the progress closely and detect errors early.

The call returns a task ID to monitor the progress:

[source,console]
----
GET _tasks/<task_id>
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

You can also open the Trained Models UI, select the Pipelines tab under ELSER to
follow the progress.

[[text-expansion-query]]
==== Semantic search by using the `text_expansion` query

To perform semantic search, use the `text_expansion` query, and provide the
query text and the ELSER model ID. The example below uses the query text "How to
avoid muscle soreness after running?", the `content_embedding` field contains
the generated ELSER output:

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
   "query":{
      "text_expansion":{
         "content_embedding":{
            "model_id":".elser_model_2",
            "model_text":"How to avoid muscle soreness after running?"
         }
      }
   }
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

The result is the top 10 documents that are closest in meaning to your query
text from the `my-index` index sorted by their relevancy. The result also
contains the extracted tokens for each of the relevant search results with their
weights. Tokens are learned associations capturing relevance, they are not
synonyms. To learn more about what tokens are, refer to
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-elser.html#elser-tokens[this page]. It is possible to exclude
tokens from source, refer to <<save-space,this section>> to learn more.

      }
    },

[[text-expansion-compound-query]]
==== Combining semantic search with other queries

You can combine `text_expansion` with other queries in a
<<compound-queries,compound query>>. For example using a filter clause in a
<<query-dsl-bool-query>> or a full text query which may or may not use the same
query text as the `text_expansion` query. This enables you to combine the search
results from both queries.

The search hits from the `text_expansion` query tend to score higher than other
{es} queries. Those scores can be regularized by increasing or decreasing the
relevance scores of each query by using the `boost` parameter. Recall on the
`text_expansion` query can be high where there is a long tail of less relevant
results. Use the `min_score` parameter to prune those less relevant documents.

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": { <1>
      "should": [
        {
          "text_expansion": {
            "content_embedding": {
              "model_text": "How to avoid muscle soreness after running?",
              "model_id": ".elser_model_2",
              "boost": 1 <2>
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "query_string": {
            "query": "toxins",
            "boost": 4 <3>
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "min_score": 10 <4>
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> Both the `text_expansion` and the `query_string` queries are in a `should`
clause of a `bool` query.
<2> The `boost` value is `1` for the `text_expansion` query which is the default
value. This means that the relevance score of the results of this query are not
boosted.
<3> The `boost` value is `4` for the `query_string` query. The relevance score
of the results of this query is increased causing them to rank higher in the
search results.
<4> Only the results with a score equal to or higher than `10` are displayed.

[[save-space]]
==== Saving disk space by excluding the ELSER tokens from document source

The tokens generated by ELSER must be indexed for use in the
<<query-dsl-text-expansion-query, text_expansion query>>. However, it is not
necessary to retain those terms in the document source. You can save disk space
by using the <<include-exclude,source exclude>> mapping to remove the ELSER
terms from the document source.

WARNING: Reindex uses the document source to populate the destination index.
**Once the ELSER terms have been excluded from the source, they cannot be**
**recovered through reindexing.** Excluding the tokens from the source is a
space-saving optimsation that should only be applied if you are certain that
reindexing will not be required in the future! It's important to carefully
consider this trade-off and make sure that excluding the ELSER terms from the
source aligns with your specific requirements and use case. Review the
<<disable-source-field>> and <<include-exclude>> sections carefully to learn
more about the possible consequences of excluding the tokens from the `_source`.

The mapping that excludes `content_embedding` from the  `_source` field can be
created by the following API call:

[source,console]
----
PUT my-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "_source": {
      "excludes": [
        "content_embedding"
      ]
    },
    "properties": {
      "content_embedding": {
        "type": "sparse_vector"
      },
      "content": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your data, the text expansion query may be faster with `track_total_hits: false`.

=== Tutorial: semantic search with the {infer} API
++++
<titleabbrev>Semantic search with the {infer} API</titleabbrev>
++++

The instructions in this tutorial shows you how to use the {infer} API with
various services to perform semantic search on your data. The following examples 
use Cohere's `embed-english-light-v3.0` model and OpenAI's 
`text-embedding-ada-002` second generation embedding model. You can use any
Cohere and OpenAI models, they are all supported by the {infer} API.

Click the name of the service you want to use on any of the widgets below to
review the corresponding instructions.

[[infer-service-requirements]]
==== Requirements

[[infer-text-embedding-task]]
==== Create the inference task

Create the {infer} task by using the <<put-inference-api>>:

[[infer-service-mappings]]
==== Create the index mapping

The mapping of the destination index - the index that contains the embeddings
that the model will create based on your input text - must be created. The
destination index must have a field with the <<dense-vector, `dense_vector`>>
field type to index the output of the used model.

[[infer-service-inference-ingest-pipeline]]
==== Create an ingest pipeline with an inference processor

Create an <<ingest,ingest pipeline>> with an
<<inference-processor,{infer} processor>> and use the model you created above to
infer against the data that is being ingested in the pipeline.

[discrete]
[[infer-load-data]]
==== Load data

In this step, you load the data that you later use in the {infer} ingest
pipeline to create embeddings from it.

Use the `msmarco-passagetest2019-top1000` data set, which is a subset of the MS
MARCO Passage Ranking data set. It consists of 200 queries, each accompanied by
a list of relevant text passages. All unique passages, along with their IDs,
have been extracted from that data set and compiled into a
https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/blob/main/docs/en/stack/ml/nlp/data/msmarco-passagetest2019-unique.tsv[tsv file].

Download the file and upload it to your cluster using the
{kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana[Data Visualizer]
in the {ml-app} UI. Assign the name `id` to the first column and `content` to
the second column. The index name is `test-data`. Once the upload is complete,
you can see an index named `test-data` with 182469 documents.

[[reindexing-data-infer]]
==== Ingest the data through the {infer} ingest pipeline

Create the embeddings from the text by reindexing the data through the {infer}
pipeline that uses the chosen model as the inference model.

include::{es-repo-dir}/tab-widgets/inference-api/infer-api-reindex-widget.asciidoc[]

The call returns a task ID to monitor the progress:

[source,console]
----
GET _tasks/<task_id>
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]

You can also cancel the reindexing process if you don't want to wait until the
reindexing process is fully complete which might take hours:

[source,console]
----
POST _tasks/<task_id>/_cancel
----
// TEST[skip:TBD]


[discrete]
[[infer-semantic-search]]
==== Semantic search

After the dataset has been enriched with the embeddings, you can query the data
using {ref}/knn-search.html#knn-semantic-search[semantic search]. Pass a
`query_vector_builder` to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) vector search API, and
provide the query text and the model you have used to create the embeddings.

NOTE: If you cancelled the reindexing process, you run the query only a part of
the data which affects the quality of your results.

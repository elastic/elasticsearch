=== Tutorial: semantic search with `semantic_text`

<titleabbrev>Semantic search with `semantic_text`</titleabbrev>
++++

beta[]

This tutorial shows you how to use the semantic text feature to perform semantic search on your data.

Semantic text simplifies the {infer} workflow by providing {infer} at ingestion time and sensible default values automatically.
You don't need to define model related settings and parameters, or create {infer} ingest pipelines.

The recommended way to use <<semantic-search,semantic search>> in the {stack} is following the `semantic_text` workflow.
When you need more control over indexing and query settings, you can still use the complete {infer} workflow (refer to  <<semantic-search-inference,this tutorial>> to review the process).

This tutorial uses the <<inference-example-elser,`elser` service>> for demonstration, but you can use any service and their supported models offered by the {infer-cap} API.

[[semantic-text-requirements]]
==== Requirements

To use the `semantic_text` field type, you must have an {infer} endpoint deployed in
your cluster using the <<put-inference-api>>.

[discrete]
[[semantic-text-infer-endpoint]]
==== Create the {infer} endpoint

Create an inference endpoint by using the <<put-inference-api>>:

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
PUT _inference/sparse_embedding/my-elser-endpoint <1>
{
  "service": "elser", <2>
  "service_settings": {
    "num_allocations": 1,
    "num_threads": 1
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The task type is `sparse_embedding` in the path as the `elser` service will
be used and ELSER creates sparse vectors. The `inference_id` is
`my-elser-endpoint`.
<2> The `elser` service is used in this example.

[NOTE]
====
You might see a 502 bad gateway error in the response when using the {kib} Console.
This error usually just reflects a timeout, while the model downloads in the background.
You can check the download progress in the {ml-app} UI.
If using the Python client, you can set the `timeout` parameter to a higher value.

[discrete]
[[semantic-text-index-mapping]]
==== Create the index mapping

The mapping of the destination index - the index that contains the embeddings
that the inference endpoint will generate based on your input text - must be created. The
destination index must have a field with the <<semantic-text,`semantic_text`>>
field type to index the output of the used inference endpoint.

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
PUT semantic-embeddings
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "semantic_text": { <1>
        "type": "semantic_text", <2>
        "inference_id": "my-elser-endpoint" <3>
      },
      "content": { <4>
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "semantic_text" <5>
      }
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The name of the field to contain the generated embeddings.
<2> The field to contain the embeddings is a `semantic_text` field.
<3> The `inference_id` is the inference endpoint you created in the previous step.
It will be used to generate the embeddings based on the input text.
Every time you ingest data into the related `semantic_text` field, this endpoint will be used for creating the vector representation of the text.
<4> The field to store the text reindexed from a source index in the  <<semantic-text-reindex-data,Reindex the data>> step.
<5> The textual data stored in the `content` field will be copied to `semantic_text` and processed by the {infer} endpoint.
The `semantic_text` field will store the embeddings generated based on the input data.

[[semantic-text-load-data]]
==== Load data

In this step, you load the data that you later use to create embeddings from it.

Use the `msmarco-passagetest2019-top1000` data set, which is a subset of the MS
MARCO Passage Ranking data set. It consists of 200 queries, each accompanied by
a list of relevant text passages. All unique passages, along with their IDs,
have been extracted from that data set and compiled into a
https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/blob/main/docs/en/stack/ml/nlp/data/msmarco-passagetest2019-unique.tsv[tsv file].

Download the file and upload it to your cluster using the
{kibana-ref}/connect-to-elasticsearch.html#upload-data-kibana[Data Visualizer]
in the {ml-app} UI. Assign the name `id` to the first column and `content` to
the second column. The index name is `test-data`. Once the upload is complete,
you can see an index named `test-data` with 182469 documents.


[discrete]
[[semantic-text-reindex-data]]
==== Reindex the data

Create the embeddings from the text by reindexing the data from the `test-data`
index to the `semantic-embeddings` index. The data in the `content` field will
be reindexed into the `content` field of the destination index. 
The `content` field data will be copied to the `semantic_text` field as a result of the `copy_to`
parameter set in the index mapping creation step. The copied data will be
processed by the {infer} endpoint associated with the `semantic_text` semantic text
field.

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
POST _reindex?wait_for_completion=false
{
  "source": { 
    "index": "test-data",
    "size": 10 <1>
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "semantic-embeddings"
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The default batch size for reindexing is 1000. Reducing size to a smaller
number makes the update of the reindexing process quicker which enables you to
follow the progress closely and detect errors early.

The call returns a task ID to monitor the progress:

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
GET _tasks/<task_id>
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

It is recommended to cancel the reindexing process if you don't want to wait
until it is fully complete which might take a long time for an inference endpoint with few assigned resources:

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
POST _tasks/<task_id>/_cancel
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]


[discrete]
[[semantic-text-semantic-search]]
==== Semantic search

After the data set has been enriched with the embeddings, you can query the data
using semantic search. Provide the `semantic_text` field name and the query text
in a `semantic` query type. The {infer} endpoint used to generate the embeddings
for the `semantic_text` field will be used to process the query text.

[source,console]
------------------------------------------------------------
GET semantic-embeddings/_search
{
  "query": {
    "semantic": { 
      "field": "semantic_text", <1>
      "query": "How to avoid muscle soreness while running?" <2>
    }
  }
}
------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]
<1> The `semantic_text` field on which you want to perform the search.
<2> The query text.

As a result, you receive the top 10 documents that are closest in meaning to the
query from the `semantic-embedding` index:

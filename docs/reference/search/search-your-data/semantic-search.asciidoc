== Semantic search

Semantic search is a search method that helps you find data based on the intent
and contextual meaning of a search query, instead of a match on query terms
(lexical search).

{es} provides semantic search capabilities using {ml-docs}/ml-nlp.html[natural
language processing (NLP)] and vector search. Deploying an NLP model to {es}
enables it to extract text embeddings out of text. Embeddings are vectors that
provide a numeric representation of a text. Pieces of content with similar
meaning have similar representations.

At query time, {es} can use the same NLP model to convert a query into
embeddings, enabling you to find documents with similar text embeddings.

This guide shows you how to implement semantic search with {es}, from selecting
an NLP model, to writing queries.

=== Select an NLP model

{es} offers the usage of a 
{ml-docs}/ml-nlp-model-ref.html#ml-nlp-model-ref-text-embedding[wide range of NLP models], 
including both dense and sparse vector models. Your choice of the language model 
is critical for implementing semantic search successfully.

While it is possible to bring your own text embedding model, achieving good 
search results through model tuning is challenging. Selecting an appropriate 
model from our third-party model list is the first step. Training the model on 
your own data is essential to ensure better search results than using only BM25. 
However, the model training process requires a team of data scientists and ML 
experts, making it expensive and time-consuming.

To address this issue, Elastic provides a pre-trained representational model 
called {ml-docs}/ml-nlp-elser.html[Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR (ELSER)]. 
ELSER, currently available only for English, is an out-of-domain sparse vector 
model that does not require fine-tuning. This adaptability makes it suitable for 
various NLP use cases out of the box. Unless you have a team of ML specialists, 
it is highly recommended to use the ELSER model.

In the case of sparse vector representation, the vectors mostly consist of zero 
values, with only a small subset containing non-zero values. This representation 
is commonly used for textual data. In the case of ELSER, each document in an 
index and the query text itself are represented by high-dimensional sparse 
vectors. The interaction between these large sparse vectors can be very 
sophisticated, as the dot product of those vectors provides greater details and 
interpretability compared to dense vectors. This sophisticated interaction 
enables ELSER to efficiently capture context.

[[semantic-search-deploy-nlp-model]]
=== Deploy the model

After you decide which model you want to use for implementing semantic search, 
you need to deploy the model in {es}.

[[semantic-search-field-mappings]]
=== Map a field for the text embeddings

Before you start using the deployed model to generate embeddings based on your 
input text, you need to prepare your index mapping first. The mapping of the 
index depends on the type of model.

[[semantic-search-generate-embeddings]]
=== Generate text embeddings

Once you have created the mappings for the index, you can generate text 
embeddings from your input text. This can be done by using an 
<<ingest,ingest pipeline>> with an <<inference-processor,inference processor>>. 
The ingest pipeline processes the input data and indexes it into the destination 
index. At index time, the inference ingest processor uses the trained model to 
infer against the data ingested through the pipeline. After you created the 
ingest pipeline with the inference processor, you can ingest your data through 
it to generate the model output.

Now it is time to perform semantic search!

=== Search the data

Depending on the type of model you have deployed, you can query rank features 
with a text expansion query, or dense vectors with a kNN search.

[[semantic-search-hybrid-search]]
=== Beyond semantic search with hybrid search

In some situations, lexical search may perform better than semantic search. For
example, when searching for single words or IDs, like product numbers.

Combining semantic and lexical search into one hybrid search request using
<<rrf,reciprocal rank fusion>> provides the best of both worlds. Not only that,
but hybrid search using reciprocal rank fusion has been shown to perform better
in general.

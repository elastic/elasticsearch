Returns search hits that match the query defined in the request.

[source,console]
----
GET /my-index-000001/_search
----
// TEST[setup:my_index]

[[search-search-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /<target>/_search`

`GET /_search`

`POST /<target>/_search`

`POST /_search`

[[search-search-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `read`
<<privileges-list-indices,index privilege>> for the target data stream, index,
or alias. For cross-cluster search, see <<cross-cluster-configuring>>.
+
To search a <<point-in-time-api,point in time (PIT)>> for an alias, you
must have the `read` index privilege for the alias's data streams or indices.

[[search-search-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Allows you to execute a search query and get back search hits that match the
query. You can provide search queries using the <<search-api-query-params-q,`q`
query string parameter>> or <<search-request-body,request body>>.

[[search-search-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<target>`::
(Optional, string) Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and aliases to
search. Supports wildcards (`*`). To search all data streams and indices, omit
this parameter or use `*` or `_all`.

[role="child_attributes"]
[[search-search-api-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

IMPORTANT: Several options for this API can be specified using a query parameter
or a request body parameter. If both parameters are specified, only the query
parameter is used.

include::{es-repo-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=allow-no-indices]
+
Defaults to `true`.

[[search-partial-responses]]
`allow_partial_search_results`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, returns partial results if there are shard request timeouts or
<<shard-failures,shard failures>>. If `false`, returns an error with
no partial results. Defaults to `true`.
+
To override the default for this field, set the
`search.default_allow_partial_results` cluster setting to `false`.

`batched_reduce_size`::
(Optional, integer) The number of shard results that should be reduced at once
on the coordinating node. This value should be used as a protection mechanism
to reduce the memory overhead per search request if the potential number of
shards in the request can be large. Defaults to `512`.

[[ccs-minimize-roundtrips]]
`ccs_minimize_roundtrips`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, network round-trips between the
coordinating node and the remote clusters are minimized when executing
{ccs} (CCS) requests. See <<ccs-network-delays>>. Defaults to `true`.

`docvalue_fields`::
(Optional, string) A comma-separated list of fields to return as the docvalue
representation of a field for each hit.

include::{es-repo-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=expand-wildcards]
+
Defaults to `open`.

`explain`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns detailed information about score
computation as part of a hit. Defaults to `false`.

include::{es-repo-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=from]
+
By default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from` and
`size` parameters. To page through more hits, use the
<<search-after,`search_after`>> parameter.

`ignore_throttled`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, concrete, expanded or aliased indices will be
ignored when frozen. Defaults to `true`.

include::{es-repo-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=index-ignore-unavailable]

`max_concurrent_shard_requests`::
(Optional, integer) Defines the number of concurrent shard requests per node
this search executes concurrently. This value should be used to limit the
impact of the search on the cluster in order to limit the number of concurrent
shard requests. Defaults to `5`.

`pre_filter_shard_size`::
(Optional, integer) Defines a threshold that enforces a pre-filter roundtrip
to prefilter search shards based on query rewriting if the number of shards
the search request expands to exceeds the threshold. This filter roundtrip can
limit the number of shards significantly if for instance a shard can not match
any documents based on its rewrite method ie. if date filters are mandatory
to match but the shard bounds and the query are disjoint.
When unspecified, the pre-filter phase is executed if any of these conditions is met:
  - The request targets more than `128` shards.
  - The request targets one or more read-only index.
  - The primary sort of the query targets an indexed field.

[[search-preference]]
`preference`::
(Optional, string)
Nodes and shards used for the search. By default, {es} selects from eligible
nodes and shards using <<search-adaptive-replica,adaptive replica selection>>,
accounting for <<shard-allocation-awareness,allocation awareness>>.
+
.Valid values for `preference`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`_only_local`::
Run the search only on shards on the local node.

`_local`::
If possible, run the search on shards on the local node. If not, select shards
using the default method.

`_only_nodes:<node-id>,<node-id>`::
Run the search on only the specified nodes IDs. If suitable shards exist on more
than one selected nodes, use shards on those nodes using the default method. If
none of the specified nodes are available, select shards from any available node
using the default method.

`_prefer_nodes:<node-id>,<node-id>`::
If possible, run the search on the specified nodes IDs. If not, select shards
using the default method.

`_shards:<shard>,<shard>`::
Run the search only on the specified shards. This value can be combined with
other `preference` values, but this value must come first. For example:
`_shards:2,3|_local`

<custom-string>::
Any string that does not start with `_`. If the cluster state and selected
shards do not change, searches using the same `<custom-string>` value are routed
to the same shards in the same order.
====


[[search-api-query-params-q]]
include::{es-repo-dir}/rest-api/common-parms.asciidoc[tag=search-q]
+
You can use the `q` parameter to run a query parameter search. Query parameter
searches do not support the full {es} <<query-dsl,Query DSL>> but are handy for
testing.
+
IMPORTANT: The `q` parameter overrides the <<request-body-search-query,`query`>>
parameter in the request body. If both parameters are specified, documents
matching the `query` request body parameter are not returned.

`request_cache`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, the caching of search results is enabled for
requests where `size` is `0`. See <<shard-request-cache>>. Defaults to index
level settings.

`rest_total_hits_as_int`::

`scroll`::
(Optional, <<time-units,time value>>)
Period to retain the <<scroll-search-context,search context>> for scrolling. See
<<scroll-search-results>>.
+
By default, this value cannot exceed `1d` (24 hours). You can change
this limit using the `search.max_keep_alive` cluster-level setting.

[[search-type]]
`search_type`::
(Optional, string)
How {wikipedia}/Tf–idf[distributed term frequencies] are calculated for
<<relevance-scores,relevance scoring>>.
+
.Valid values for `search_type`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`query_then_fetch`::
(Default)
Distributed term frequencies are calculated locally for each shard running the
search. We recommend this option for faster searches with potentially less
accurate scoring.

[[dfs-query-then-fetch]]
`dfs_query_then_fetch`::
Distributed term frequencies are calculated globally, using information gathered
from all shards running the search. While this option increases the accuracy of
scoring, it adds a round-trip to each shard, which can result in slower
searches.
====

`seq_no_primary_term`::
(Optional, Boolean) If `true`, returns sequence number and primary term of the
last modification of each hit. See <<optimistic-concurrency-control>>.

`size`::
(Optional, integer) Defines the number of hits to return. Defaults to `10`.
+
By default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from` and
`size` parameters. To page through more hits, use the
<<search-after,`search_after`>> parameter.

pass `_source: true` to return both source fields and
stored fields in the search response.

`suggest_field`::
(Optional, string) Specifies which field to use for suggestions.

`suggest_text`::
(Optional, string) The source text for which the suggestions should be

by their respective types in the response. Defaults to `true`.

`version`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, returns document version as part of a hit. Defaults to `false`.

This parameter is only returned if the <<search-api-scroll-query-param,`scroll`
query parameter>> is specified in the request.

`took`::
+
--
(integer)
Milliseconds it took {es} to execute the request.

This value is calculated by measuring the time elapsed
between receipt of a request on the coordinating node
and the time at which the coordinating node is ready to send the response.

Took time includes:

* Communication time between the coordinating node and data nodes
* Time the request spends in the `search` <<modules-threadpool,thread pool>>,
  queued for execution
* Actual execution time

Took time does *not* include:

* Time needed to send the request to {es}

typically happens when a search request includes a range filter and the
shard only has values that fall outside of that range.

`failed`::
(integer)
Number of shards that failed to execute the request. Note that shards
that are not allocated will be considered neither successful nor failed.
Having `failed+successful` less than `total` is thus an indication that
some of the shards were not allocated.

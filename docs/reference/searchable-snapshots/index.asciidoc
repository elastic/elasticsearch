== {search-snaps-cap}

{search-snaps-cap} let you use <<snapshot-restore,snapshots>> to search
infrequently accessed and read-only data in a very cost-effective fashion. The
<<cold-tier,cold>> and <<frozen-tier,frozen>> data tiers use {search-snaps} to
reduce your storage and operating costs.

{search-snaps-cap} eliminate the need for <<scalability,replica shards>>,
potentially halving the local storage needed to search your data.
{search-snaps-cap} rely on the same snapshot mechanism you already use for
backups and have minimal impact on your snapshot repository storage costs.

=== Using {search-snaps}

Searching a {search-snap} index is the same as searching any other index.

By default, {search-snap} indices have no replicas. The underlying snapshot
provides resilience and the query volume is expected to be low enough that a
single shard copy will be sufficient. However, if you need to support a higher
query volume, you can add replicas by adjusting the `index.number_of_replicas`
index setting.

If a node fails and {search-snap} shards need to be recovered elsewhere, there
is a brief window of time while {es} allocates the shards to other nodes where
the cluster health will not be `green`. Searches that hit these shards may fail
or return partial results until the shards are reallocated to healthy nodes.

You typically manage {search-snaps} through {ilm-init}. The
<<ilm-searchable-snapshot, searchable snapshots>> action automatically converts
a regular index into a {search-snap} index when it reaches the `cold` or
`frozen` phase. You can also make indices in existing snapshots searchable by
manually mounting them using the <<searchable-snapshots-api-mount-snapshot,
mount snapshot>> API.

To mount an index from a snapshot that contains multiple indices, we recommend
creating a <<clone-snapshot-api, clone>> of the snapshot that contains only the
index you want to search, and mounting the clone. You should not delete a
snapshot if it has any mounted indices, so creating a clone enables you to
manage the lifecycle of the backup snapshot independently of any {search-snaps}.
If you use {ilm-init} to manage your {search-snaps} then it will automatically
look after cloning the snapshot as needed.

You can control the allocation of the shards of {search-snap} indices using the
same mechanisms as for regular indices. For example, you could use
<<shard-allocation-filtering>> to restrict {search-snap} shards to a subset of
your nodes.

The speed of recovery of a {search-snap} index is limited by the repository
setting `max_restore_bytes_per_sec` and the node setting
`indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` just like a normal restore operation. By
default `max_restore_bytes_per_sec` is unlimited, but the default for
`indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` depends on the configuration of the node.
See <<recovery-settings>>.

We recommend that you <<indices-forcemerge, force-merge>> indices to a single
segment per shard before taking a snapshot that will be mounted as a
{search-snap} index. Each read from a snapshot repository takes time and costs
money, and the fewer segments there are the fewer reads are needed to restore
the snapshot or to respond to a search.

[TIP]
====
{search-snaps-cap} are ideal for managing a large archive of historical data.
Historical information is typically searched less frequently than recent data
and therefore may not need replicas for their performance benefits.

For more complex or time-consuming searches, you can use <<async-search>> with
{search-snaps}.

[[searchable-snapshots-repository-types]]
// tag::searchable-snapshot-repo-types[]
Use any of the following repository types with searchable snapshots:

* {plugins}/repository-s3.html[AWS S3]
* {plugins}/repository-gcs.html[Google Cloud Storage]
* {plugins}/repository-azure.html[Azure Blob Storage]
* {plugins}/repository-hdfs.html[Hadoop Distributed File Store (HDFS)]
* <<snapshots-filesystem-repository,Shared filesystems>> such as NFS
* <<snapshots-read-only-repository,Read-only HTTP and HTTPS repositories>>

You can also use alternative implementations of these repository types, for
instance
{plugins}/repository-s3-client.html#repository-s3-compatible-services[MinIO],
as long as they are fully compatible. Use the <<repo-analysis-api>> API
to analyze your repository's suitability for use with searchable snapshots.

[[how-searchable-snapshots-work]]
=== How {search-snaps} work

When an index is mounted from a snapshot, {es} allocates its shards to data
nodes within the cluster. The data nodes then automatically retrieve the
relevant shard data from the repository onto local storage, based on the
<<searchable-snapshot-mount-storage-options,mount options>> specified. If
possible, searches use data from local storage. If the data is not available
locally, {es} downloads the data that it needs from the snapshot repository.

If a node holding one of these shards fails, {es} automatically allocates the
affected shards on another node, and that node restores the relevant shard data
from the repository. No replicas are needed, and no complicated monitoring or
orchestration is necessary to restore lost shards. Although searchable snapshot
indices have no replicas by default, you may add replicas to these indices by
adjusting `index.number_of_replicas`. Replicas of {search-snap} shards are
recovered by copying data from the snapshot repository, just like primaries of
{search-snap} shards. In contrast, replicas of regular indices are restored by
copying data from the primary.

[discrete]
[[searchable-snapshot-mount-storage-options]]
==== Mount options

To search a snapshot, you must first mount it locally as an index. Usually
{ilm-init} will do this automatically, but you can also call the
<<searchable-snapshots-api-mount-snapshot,mount snapshot>> API yourself. There
are two options for mounting an index from a snapshot, each with different
performance characteristics and local storage footprints:

[[fully-mounted]]
Fully mounted index::
Fully caches the snapshotted index's shards in the {es} cluster. {ilm-init} uses
this option in the `hot` and `cold` phases.
+
Search performance for a fully mounted index is normally comparable to a regular
index, since there is minimal need to access the snapshot repository. While
recovery is ongoing, search performance may be slower than with a regular index
because a search may need some data that has not yet been retrieved into the
local cache. If that happens, {es} will eagerly retrieve the data needed to
complete the search in parallel with the ongoing recovery. On-disk data is
preserved across restarts, such that the node does not need to re-download data
that is already stored on the node after a restart.

[[partially-mounted]]
Partially mounted index::
Uses a local cache containing only recently searched parts of the snapshotted
index's data. This cache has a fixed size and is shared across shards of
partially mounted indices allocated on the same data node. {ilm-init} uses this
option in the `frozen` phase.
+
If a search requires data that is not in the cache, {es} fetches the missing
data from the snapshot repository. Searches that require these fetches are
slower, but the fetched data is stored in the cache so that similar searches can
be served more quickly in future. {es} will evict infrequently used data from
the cache to free up space. The cache is cleared when a node is restarted.
+
Although slower than a fully mounted index or a regular index, a partially
mounted index still returns search results quickly, even for large data sets,
because the layout of data in the repository is heavily optimized for search.
Many searches will need to retrieve only a small subset of the total shard data
before returning results.

To partially mount an index, you must have one or more nodes with a shared cache
available. By default, dedicated frozen data tier nodes (nodes with the
`data_frozen` role and no other data roles) have a shared cache configured using
the greater of 90% of total disk space and total disk space subtracted a
headroom of 100GB.

Using a dedicated frozen tier is highly recommended for production use. If you
do not have a dedicated frozen tier, you must configure the
`xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size` setting to reserve space for the
cache on one or more nodes. Partially mounted indices are only allocated to
nodes that have a shared cache.

[[searchable-snapshots-shared-cache]]
`xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Disk space reserved for the shared cache of partially mounted indices. Accepts a
percentage of total disk space or an absolute <<byte-units,byte value>>.
Defaults to `90%` of total disk space for dedicated frozen data tier nodes.
Otherwise defaults to `0b`.

`xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size.max_headroom`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
For dedicated frozen tier nodes, the max headroom to maintain. If
`xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size` is not explicitly set, this
setting defaults to `100GB`. Otherwise it defaults to `-1` (not set). You can
only configure this setting if `xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size` is
set as a percentage.

To illustrate how these settings work in concert let us look at two examples
when using the default values of the settings on a dedicated frozen node:

* A 4000 GB disk will result in a shared cache sized at 3900 GB. 90% of 4000 GB
is 3600 GB, leaving 400 GB headroom. The default `max_headroom` of 100 GB takes
effect, and the result is therefore 3900 GB.

* A 400 GB disk will result in a shared cache sized at 360 GB.

You can configure the settings in `elasticsearch.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size: 4TB
----

IMPORTANT: Currently, you can configure
`xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size` on any node. However, if the cache size is set on any
node that does not have the <<data-frozen-node,`data_frozen`>> role, it will be treated as though it
is set to `0b`. Additionally, nodes with a shared  cache can only have a single
<<path-settings,data path>>.

{es} also uses a dedicated system index named `.snapshot-blob-cache` to speed up
the recoveries of {search-snap} shards. This index is used as an additional
caching layer on top of the partially or fully mounted data and contains the
minimal required data to start the {search-snap} shards. {es} automatically
deletes the documents that are no longer used in this index. This periodic clean
up can be tuned using the following settings:

`searchable_snapshots.blob_cache.periodic_cleanup.interval`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The interval at which the periodic cleanup of the `.snapshot-blob-cache` index
is scheduled. Defaults to every hour (`1h`).

`searchable_snapshots.blob_cache.periodic_cleanup.retention_period`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The retention period to keep obsolete documents in the `.snapshot-blob-cache`
index. Defaults to every hour (`1h`).

`searchable_snapshots.blob_cache.periodic_cleanup.batch_size`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The number of documents that are searched for and bulk-deleted at once during
the periodic cleanup of the `.snapshot-blob-cache` index. Defaults to `100`.

`searchable_snapshots.blob_cache.periodic_cleanup.pit_keep_alive`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
The value used for the <point-in-time-keep-alive,point-in-time keep alive>>
requests executed during the periodic cleanup of the `.snapshot-blob-cache`
index. Defaults to `10m`.

[[searchable-snapshots-costs]]
=== Reduce costs with {search-snaps}

In most cases, {search-snaps} reduce the costs of running a cluster by removing
the need for replica shards  and for shard data to be copied between nodes.
However, if it's particularly expensive to retrieve data from a snapshot
repository in your environment, {search-snaps} may be more costly than regular
indices. Ensure that the cost structure of your operating environment is
compatible with {search-snaps} before using them.

[discrete]
[[searchable-snapshots-costs-replicas]]
==== Replica costs

For resiliency, a regular index requires multiple redundant copies of each shard
across multiple nodes. If a node fails, {es} uses the redundancy to rebuild any
lost shard copies. A {search-snap} index doesn't require replicas. If a node
containing a {search-snap} index fails, {es} can rebuild the lost shard cache
from the snapshot repository.

Without replicas, rarely-accessed {search-snap} indices require far fewer
resources. A cold data tier that contains replica-free fully-mounted
{search-snap} indices requires half the nodes and disk space of a tier
containing the same data in regular indices. The frozen tier, which contains
only partially-mounted {search-snap} indices, requires even fewer resources.

[discrete]
[[snapshot-retrieval-costs]]
==== Data transfer costs

When a shard of a regular index is moved between nodes, its contents are copied
from another node in your cluster. In many environments, the costs of moving
data between nodes are significant, especially if running in a Cloud environment
with nodes in different zones. In contrast, when mounting a {search-snap} index
or moving one of its shards, the data is always copied from the snapshot
repository. This is typically much cheaper.

WARNING: Most cloud providers charge significant fees for data transferred
between regions and for data transferred out of their platforms. You should only
mount snapshots into a cluster that is in the same region as the snapshot
repository. If you wish to search data across multiple regions, configure
multiple clusters and use <<modules-cross-cluster-search,{ccs}>> or
<<xpack-ccr,{ccr}>> instead of {search-snaps}.

[discrete]
[[back-up-restore-searchable-snapshots]]
=== Back up and restore {search-snaps}

You can use <<snapshots-take-snapshot,regular snapshots>> to back up a cluster
containing {search-snap} indices. When you restore a snapshot containing
{search-snap} indices, these indices are restored as {search-snap} indices
again.

Before you restore a snapshot containing a {search-snap} index, you must first
<<snapshots-register-repository,register the repository>> containing the
original index snapshot. When restored, the {search-snap} index mounts the
original index snapshot from its original repository. If wanted, you can use
separate repositories for regular snapshots and {search-snaps}.

A snapshot of a {search-snap} index contains only a small amount of metadata
which identifies its original index snapshot. It does not contain any data from
the original index. The restore of a backup will fail to restore any
{search-snap} indices whose original index snapshot is unavailable.

Because {search-snap} indices are not regular indices, it is not possible to use
a <<snapshots-source-only-repository,source-only repository>> to take snapshots
of {search-snap} indices.

[discrete]
[[searchable-snapshots-reliability]]
=== Reliability of {search-snaps}

The sole copy of the data in a {search-snap} index is the underlying snapshot,
stored in the repository. For example:

* You cannot unregister a repository while any of the searchable snapshots it
contains are mounted in {es}. You also cannot delete a snapshot if any of its
indices are mounted as a searchable snapshot in the same cluster.

* If you mount indices from snapshots held in a repository to which a different
cluster has write access then you must make sure that the other cluster does not
delete these snapshots.

* If you delete a snapshot while it is mounted as a searchable snapshot then the
data is lost. Similarly, if the repository fails or corrupts the contents of the
snapshot then the data is lost.

* Although {es} may have cached the data onto local storage, these caches may be
incomplete and cannot be used to recover any data after a repository failure.
You must make sure that your repository is reliable and protects against
corruption of your data while it is at rest in the repository.

The blob storage offered by all major public cloud providers typically offers
very good protection against data loss or corruption. If you manage your own
repository storage then you are responsible for its reliability.

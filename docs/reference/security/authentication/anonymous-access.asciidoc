=== Enabling anonymous access

TIP: To embed {kib} dashboards or grant access to {kib} without requiring
credentials, use {kib}'s
{kibana-ref}/kibana-authentication.html#anonymous-authentication[anonymous
authentication] feature instead.

Incoming requests are considered to be _anonymous_ if no authentication token 
can be extracted from the incoming request. By default, anonymous requests are rejected and an authentication error is returned (status code `401`). 

To enable anonymous access, you assign one or more roles to anonymous
users in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file. For example, the following
configuration assigns anonymous users `role1` and `role2`:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc:
  anonymous:
    username: anonymous_user <1>
    roles: role1, role2 <2>
    authz_exception: true <3>
----------------------------------------
<1> The username/principal of the anonymous user. Defaults to 
`_es_anonymous_user` if not specified.
<2> The roles to associate with the anonymous user. If no roles are specified, anonymous access is disabled--anonymous requests will be rejected and return an authentication error.
<3> When `true`, a 403 HTTP status code is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the permissions needed to perform the requested action and the
user will NOT be prompted to provide credentials to access the requested 
resource. When `false`, a 401 HTTP status code is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the necessary permissions and the user is prompted for 
credentials to access the requested resource. If you are using anonymous access 
in combination with HTTP, you might need to set `authz_exception` to `false` 
if your client does not support preemptive basic authentication. Defaults to 
`true`.

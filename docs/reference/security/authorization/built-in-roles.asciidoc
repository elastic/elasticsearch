=== Built-in roles

The {stack-security-features} apply a default role to all users, including
<<anonymous-access, anonymous users>>. The default role enables users to access
the authenticate endpoint, change their own passwords, and get information about
themselves.

There is also a set of built-in roles you can explicitly assign to users. These
roles have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be updated.

[[built-in-roles-apm-system]] `apm_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the APM system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}.

[[built-in-roles-apm-user]] `apm_user` ::
Grants the privileges required for APM users (such as `read` and
`view_index_metadata` privileges on the `apm-*` and `.ml-anomalies*` indices).
deprecated:[7.13.0,"See {kibana-ref}/apm-app-users.html[APM app users and privileges\] for alternatives."].

[[built-in-roles-beats-admin]] `beats_admin` ::
Grants access to the `.management-beats` index, which contains configuration
information for the Beats.

[[built-in-roles-beats-system]] `beats_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the Beats system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}.

--
[NOTE]
===============================
* This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.
* This role does not provide access to the beats indices and is not
suitable for writing beats output to {es}.

Monitoring users should also be assigned the `kibana_admin` role, or another role

[[built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent]] `remote_monitoring_agent`::

user has access to only their own reports.
Reporting users should also be assigned additional roles that grant
{kibana-ref}/xpack-security-authorization.html[access to {kib}] as well as read
access to the <<roles-indices-priv,indices>> that will be used to generate reports.

[[built-in-roles-rollup-admin]] `rollup_admin`::
Grants `manage_rollup` cluster privileges, which enable you to manage and execute all rollup actions.

[[built-in-roles-rollup-user]] `rollup_user`::
Grants `monitor_rollup` cluster privileges, which enable you to perform read-only operations related to rollups.

[[built-in-roles-snapshot-user]] `snapshot_user`::
Grants the necessary privileges to create snapshots of **all** the indices and
to view their metadata. This role enables users to view the configuration of
existing snapshot repositories and snapshot details. It does not grant authority
to remove or add repositories or to restore snapshots. It also does not enable
to change index settings or to read or update data stream or index data.

[[built-in-roles-superuser]] `superuser`::
Grants full access to cluster management and data indices. This role also grants
direct read-only access to restricted indices like `.security`. A user with the
`superuser` role can <<run-as-privilege, impersonate>> any other user in the system.
+
On {ecloud}, all standard users, including those with the `superuser` role are
restricted from performing <<operator-only-functionality,operator-only>> actions.
+
IMPORTANT: This role can manage security and create roles with unlimited privileges.
Take extra care when assigning it to a user.

[[built-in-roles-transform-admin]] `transform_admin`::
Grants `manage_transform` cluster privileges, which enable you to manage

{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

[[built-in-roles-transport-client]] `transport_client`::
Grants the privileges required to access the cluster through the Java Transport
Client. The Java Transport Client fetches information about the nodes in the
cluster using the _Node Liveness API_ and the _Cluster State API_ (when
sniffing is enabled). Assign your users this role if they use the
Transport Client.
+
NOTE: Using the Transport Client effectively means the users are granted access
to the cluster state. This means users can view the metadata over all indices,
index templates, mappings, node and basically everything about the cluster.
However, this role does not grant permission to view the data in all indices.

[[built-in-roles-viewer]] `viewer` ::

Grants read-only access to all features in {kib} (including Solutions) and to data indices.
+

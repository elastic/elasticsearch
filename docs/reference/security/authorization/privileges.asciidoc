[[privileges-list-indices]]
==== Indices privileges

[horizontal]
`all`::
Any action on an index or data stream.

`auto_configure`::
Permits auto-creation of indices and data streams. An auto-create action is the
result of an <<docs-index_,index>> or <<docs-bulk,bulk>> request that targets a
non-existent index or data stream rather than an explicit
<<indices-create-index,create index>> or
<<indices-create-data-stream,create data stream>> request. Also permits
auto-update of mappings on indices and data streams if they do not contradict
existing mappings. An auto-update mapping action is the result of an index or
bulk request on an index or data stream that contains new fields that may
be mapped rather than an explicit <<indices-put-mapping,update mapping>> request.

`create`::
Privilege to index documents.
+
deprecated:[8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but
not the data streams mapping), using
the {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[updating mapping API] or by relying on
{ref}/dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic field mapping]. In a future major release,
this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.
+
--
NOTE: This privilege does not restrict the index operation to the creation
of documents but instead restricts API use to the index API. The index API
allows a user to overwrite a previously indexed document. See the `create_doc`
privilege for an alternative.

--

`create_doc`::
Privilege to index documents.
It does not grant the permission to update or overwrite existing documents.
+
deprecated:[8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but
not the data streams mapping), using
the {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[updating mapping API] or by relying on
{ref}/dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic field mapping]. In a future major release,
this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.
+
--
[NOTE]
====

This privilege relies on the `op_type` of indexing requests (<<docs-index_>> and
<<docs-bulk>>). When ingesting documents as a user who has the `create_doc`
privilege (and no higher privilege such as `index` or `write`), you must ensure that
'op_type' is set to 'create' through one of the following:

* Explicitly setting the `op_type` in the index or bulk APIs
* Using the `_create` endpoint for the index API
* Creating a document with an auto-generated `_id`
====

--

`create_index`::
Privilege to create an index or data stream. A create index request may contain
aliases to be added to the index once created. In that case the request
requires the `manage` privilege as well, on both the index and the aliases
names.

`cross_cluster_replication`::
beta:[] Privileges to perform cross-cluster replication for indices located on
<<remote-clusters-api-key,remote clusters configured with the API key based model>>.
This privilege should only be used for
the `privileges` field of <<roles-remote-indices-priv,remote indices privileges>>.

`cross_cluster_replication_internal`::
beta:[] Privileges to perform supporting actions for cross-cluster replication from
<<remote-clusters-api-key,remote clusters configured with the API key based model>>.
+
--
NOTE: This privilege should _not_ be directly granted. It is used internally by
<<security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key>> and <<security-api-update-cross-cluster-api-key>>
to manage cross-cluster API keys.

--

`delete`::
Privilege to delete documents.

`delete_index`::
Privilege to delete an index or data stream.

`index`::
Privilege to index and update documents.
+
deprecated:[8.0] Also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but
not the data streams mapping), using
the {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[updating mapping API] or by relying on
{ref}/dynamic-mapping.html[dynamic field mapping]. In a future major release,
this privilege will not grant any mapping update permissions.

`maintenance`::
Permits refresh, flush, synced flush and force merge index administration operations.
No privilege to read or write index data or otherwise manage the index.

`manage`::
All `monitor` privileges plus index and data stream administration (aliases,
analyze, cache clear, close, delete, exists, flush, mapping, open, field capabilities,
force merge, refresh, settings, search shards, validate query).

`manage_follow_index`::
All actions that are required to manage the lifecycle of a follower index, which
includes creating a follower index, closing it, and converting it to a regular
index. This privilege is necessary only on clusters that contain follower indices.

`manage_ilm`::
All {Ilm} operations relating to managing the execution of policies of an index
or data stream. This includes operations such as retrying policies and removing
a policy from an index or data stream.

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="released"]
`manage_data_stream_lifecycle`::
All data stream lifecycle operations relating to reading and managing the built-in lifecycle of a data stream.
This includes operations such as adding and removing a lifecycle from a data stream.
endif::[]

`manage_leader_index`::
All actions that are required to manage the lifecycle of a leader index, which
includes <<ccr-post-forget-follower,forgetting a follower>>. This
privilege is necessary only on clusters that contain leader indices.

`monitor`::
All actions that are required for monitoring (recovery, segments info, index
stats and status).

`read`::
Read-only access to actions (count, explain, get, mget, get indexed scripts,
more like this, multi percolate/search/termvector, percolate, scroll,
clear_scroll, search, suggest, tv).

`read_cross_cluster`::
Read-only access to the search action from a <<remote-clusters,remote cluster>>.

`view_index_metadata`::
Read-only access to index and data stream metadata (aliases, exists,
field capabilities, field mappings, get index, get data stream, ilm explain,
mappings, search shards, settings, validate query).
This privilege is available for use primarily by {kib} users.

`write`::
Privilege to perform all write operations to documents, which includes the
permission to index, update, and delete documents as well as performing bulk
operations, while also allowing to dynamically update the index mapping.
+
deprecated:[8.0] It also grants the permission to update the index mapping (but
not the data streams mapping), using the {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[updating mapping API].
This will be retracted in a future major release.


==== Run as privilege

The `run_as` permission enables an authenticated user to submit requests on
behalf of another user. The value can be a user name or a comma-separated list
of user names. (You can also specify users as an array of strings or a YAML
sequence.) For more information, see
<<run-as-privilege>>.

[[application-privileges]]
==== Application privileges

Application privileges are managed within {es} and can be retrieved with the
<<security-api-has-privileges,has privileges API>> and the
<<security-api-get-privileges,get application privileges API>>. They do
not, however, grant access to any actions or resources within {es}. Their
purpose is to enable applications to represent and store their own privilege
models within {es} roles.

To create application privileges, use the
<<security-api-put-privileges,add application privileges API>>. You can
then associate these application privileges with roles, as described in
<<defining-roles>>.

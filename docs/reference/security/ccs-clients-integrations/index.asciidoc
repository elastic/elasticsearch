== Securing clients and integrations

You will need to update the configuration for several <<http-clients,clients>>
to work with a secured {es} cluster.

The {es} {security-features} enable you to secure your {es} cluster. But
{es} itself is only one product within the {stack}. It is often the case that
other products in the {stack} are connected to the cluster and therefore need to
be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:

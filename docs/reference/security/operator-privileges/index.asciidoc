== Operator privileges

NOTE: {cloud-only}

With a typical {es} deployment, people who administer the cluster also operate
the cluster at the infrastructure level. User authorization based on
<<authorization,role-based access control (RBAC)>> is effective and reliable for
this environment. However, in more managed environments, such as
{ess-trial}[{ess}], there is a distinction between the operator of the cluster
infrastructure and the administrator of the cluster. 

Operator privileges limit some functionality to operator users _only_. Operator
users are just regular {es} users with access to specific
<<operator-only-functionality,operator-only functionality>>. These
privileges are not available to cluster administrators, even if they log in as
a highly privileged user such as the `elastic` user or another user with the
`superuser` role. By limiting system access, operator privileges enhance the
{es} security model while safeguarding user capabilities.

Operator privileges are enabled on {ecloud}, which means that some 
infrastructure management functionality is restricted and cannot be accessed by
your administrative users. This capability protects your cluster from unintended 
infrastructure changes.

=== Operator privileges for snapshot and restore

NOTE: {cloud-only}

Invoking <<operator-only-apis,operator-only APIs>> or updating
<<operator-only-dynamic-cluster-settings,operator-only dynamic cluster settings>>
typically results in changes in the cluster state. The cluster state can be
included in a cluster <<snapshot-restore,snapshot>>. Snapshots are a great way
to preserve the data of a cluster, which can later be restored to bootstrap a
new cluster, perform migration, or disaster recovery, for example. In a
traditional self-managed environment, the intention is for the restore process
to copy the entire cluster state over when requested. However, in a more
managed environment, such as {ess-trial}[{ess}], data that is associated with
<<operator-only-functionality,operator-only functionality>> is explicitly
managed by the infrastructure code.

Restoring snapshot data associated with
operator-only functionality could be problematic
because:

1. A snapshot could contain incorrect values for operator-only functionalities.
For example, the snapshot could have been taken in a different cluster where 
requirements are different or the operator privileges feature is not enabled. 
Restoring data associated with operator-only functionality breaks the guarantee
of operator privileges.
2. Even when the infrastructure code can correct the values immediately after
a restore, there will always be a short period of time when the cluster could be
in an inconsistent state.
3. The infrastructure code prefers to configure operator-only functionality from
a single place, that is to say, through API calls.

Therefore,
<<configure-operator-privileges,*when the operator privileges feature is enabled*>>,
snapshot data that is associated with any operator-only functionality is *not* 
restored.

NOTE: That information is still included when taking a snapshot so that all data
is always preserved.

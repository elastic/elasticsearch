<titleabbrev>{watcher} settings</titleabbrev>
++++

You configure {watcher} settings to set up {watcher} and send notifications via
<<email-notification-settings,email>>,
<<slack-notification-settings,Slack>>, and
<<pagerduty-notification-settings, PagerDuty>>.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {es} keystore.
For more information about creating and updating the {es} keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>. Dynamic settings can also be updated across a cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings API>>.

[[general-notification-settings]]
==== General Watcher Settings
`xpack.watcher.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable {watcher} on the node.

`xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data`::
Set to `true` to encrypt sensitive data. If this setting is enabled, you
must also specify the `xpack.watcher.encryption_key` setting. For more
information, see
{xpack-ref}/encrypting-data.html[Encrypting sensitive data in {watcher}].

`xpack.watcher.encryption_key` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Specifies the path to a file that contains a key for encrypting sensitive data.
If `xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data` is set to `true`, this setting is
required. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/encrypting-data.html[Encrypting sensitive data in {watcher}].

`xpack.watcher.history.cleaner_service.enabled`::
added:[6.3.0,Default changed to `true`.]
deprecated:[7.0.0,Watcher history indices are now managed by the `watch-history-ilm-policy` ILM policy]
+
Set to `true` (default) to enable the cleaner service. If this setting is
`true`, the `xpack.monitoring.enabled` setting must also be set to `true` with
a local exporter enabled. The cleaner service removes previous versions of
{watcher} indices (for example, `.watcher-history*`) when it determines that
they are old. The duration of {watcher} indices is determined by the
`xpack.monitoring.history.duration` setting, which defaults to 7 days. For
more information about that setting, see <<monitoring-settings>>.

`xpack.http.proxy.host`::
Specifies the address of the proxy server to use to connect to HTTP services.

`xpack.http.proxy.port`::
Specifies the port number to use to connect to the proxy server.

`xpack.http.default_connection_timeout`::
The maximum period to wait until abortion of the request, when a
connection is being initiated.

`xpack.http.default_read_timeout`::
The maximum period of inactivity between two data packets, before the
request is aborted.

`xpack.http.max_response_size`::
Specifies the maximum size an HTTP response is allowed to have, defaults to
`10mb`, the maximum configurable value is `50mb`.

`xpack.http.whitelist`::
A list of URLs, that the internal HTTP client is allowed to connect to. This
client is used in the HTTP input, the webhook, the slack, pagerduty,
and jira actions. This setting can be updated dynamically.  It defaults to `*`
allowing everything. Note: If you configure this setting and you are using one
of the slack/pagerduty actions, you have to ensure that the
corresponding endpoints are whitelisted as well.

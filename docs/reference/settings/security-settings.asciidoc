[[security-settings]]
=== Security settings in {es}
++++
<titleabbrev>Security settings</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, the {es} {security-features} are disabled when you have a basic or
trial license. To enable {security-features}, use the `xpack.security.enabled`
setting.

You configure `xpack.security` settings to
<<anonymous-access-settings,enable anonymous access>> and perform message
authentication,
<<field-document-security-settings,set up document and field level security>>,
<<realm-settings,configure realms>>,
<<ssl-tls-settings,encrypt communications with SSL>>,and
<<auditing-settings,audit security events>>.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {es} keystore.
For more information about creating and updating the {es} keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>.

[discrete]
[[general-security-settings]]
==== General security settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Set to `true` to enable {es} {security-features} on the node. +
+
--
If set to `false`, which is the default value for basic and trial licenses,
{security-features} are disabled. It also affects all {kib} instances that
connect to this {es} instance; you do not need to disable {security-features} in
those `kibana.yml` files. For more information about disabling {security-features}
in specific {kib} instances, see
{kibana-ref}/security-settings-kb.html[{kib} security settings].

TIP: If you have gold or higher licenses, the default value is `true`; we
recommend that you explicitly add this setting to avoid confusion.

--

`xpack.security.hide_settings`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
A comma-separated list of settings that are omitted from the results of the
<<cluster-nodes-info,cluster nodes info API>>. You can use wildcards to include
multiple settings in the list. For example, the following value hides all the
settings for the ad1 active_directory realm:
`xpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.ad1.*`.
The API already omits all `ssl` settings, `bind_dn`, and `bind_password` due to
the sensitive nature of the information.

`xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Enables fips mode of operation. Set this to `true` if you run this {es} instance in a FIPS 140-2 enabled JVM. For more information, see <<fips-140-compliance>>. Defaults to `false`.

[discrete]
[[password-hashing-settings]]
==== Password hashing settings

`xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)

`elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see <<anonymous-access>>.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.username`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The username (principal) of the anonymous user. Defaults to `_es_anonymous_user`.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.roles`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The roles to associate with the anonymous user. Required.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.authz_exception`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
When `true`, an HTTP 403 response is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the appropriate permissions for the requested action. The
user is not prompted to provide credentials to access the requested
resource. When set to `false`, an HTTP 401 response is returned and the user
can provide credentials with the appropriate permissions to gain
access. Defaults to `true`.

[discrete]
[[security-automata-settings]]
==== Automata Settings

In places where the {security-features} accept wildcard patterns (e.g. index
patterns in roles, group matches in the role mapping API), each pattern is
compiled into an Automaton. The follow settings are available to control this
behaviour.

`xpack.security.automata.max_determinized_states`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The upper limit on how many automaton states may be created by a single pattern.
This protects against too-difficult (e.g. exponentially hard) patterns.
Defaults to `100,000`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.enabled`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Whether to cache the compiled automata. Compiling automata can be CPU intensive
and may slowdown some operations. The cache reduces the frequency with which
automata need to be compiled.
Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.size`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The maximum number of items to retain in the automata cache.
Defaults to `10,000`.

recent usage).
Defaults to `48h` (48 hours).

[discrete]
[[field-document-security-settings]]
==== Document and field level security settings

You can set the following document and field level security
settings in `elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see
<<field-and-document-access-control>>.

`xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Set to `false` to prevent document and field level security
from being configured. Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.ttl`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The time-to-live for cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to expire entries that are
unused for `2h` (2 hours).

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.size`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The maximum memory usage of cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Can be configured as a raw number
of bytes (such as `200mb` or `1g`) or a percentage of the node's JVM heap
memory (such as `5%`). When the default value is exceeded, the least recently
used entries are evicted. Defaults to `10%` of the heap assigned to the node.

[discrete]

==== Token service settings

You can set the following token service settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.

`xpack.security.authc.token.enabled`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Set to `false` to disable the built-in token service. Defaults to `true` unless
 `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is `false`. This prevents sniffing the token
  from a connection over plain http.

`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The length of time that a token is valid for. By default this value is `20m` or
20 minutes. The maximum value is 1 hour.

(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Set to `false` to disable the built-in API key service. Defaults to `true` unless
 `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is `false`. This prevents sniffing the API key
  from a connection over plain http.

`xpack.security.authc.api_key.hashing.algorithm`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Specifies the hashing algorithm that is used for securing API key credentials.
See <<password-hashing-algorithms>>. Defaults to `pbkdf2`.

`xpack.security.authc.api_key.cache.ttl`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The time-to-live for cached API key entries. A API key id and a hash of its
API key are cached for this period of time. Specify the time period using

this setting is not valid. For more information on
the different modes, see <<ldap-realm>>.

`authorization_realms`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The names of the realms that should be consulted for delegated authorization.
If this setting is used, then the LDAP realm does not perform role mapping and

the different modes, see <<ldap-realm>>.

`user_search.scope`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
The scope of the user search. Valid values are `sub_tree`, `one_level` or
`base`. `one_level` only searches objects directly contained within the
`base_dn`. `sub_tree` searches all objects contained under `base_dn`.
`base` specifies that the `base_dn` is the user object, and that it is
the only user considered. Defaults to `sub_tree`.

`user_search.filter`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Specifies the filter used to search the directory in attempts to match
an entry with the username provided by the user. Defaults to `(uid={0})`.

only group considered. Defaults to  `sub_tree`.

`group_search.filter`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Specifies a filter to use to look up a group.
When not set, the realm searches for `group`, `groupOfNames`, `groupOfUniqueNames`,
or `posixGroup` with the attributes `member`, `memberOf`, or `memberUid`. Any
instance of `{0}` in the filter is replaced by the user attribute defined in
`group_search.user_attribute`.

`group_search.user_attribute`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Specifies the user attribute that is fetched and provided as a parameter to
the filter. If not set, the user DN is passed into the filter. Defaults to Empty.

`unmapped_groups_as_roles`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
If set to `true`, the names of any unmapped LDAP groups are used as role names

[[load-balancing]]
===== Load balancing and failover

The <<static-cluster-setting,static>> `load_balance.type` setting can have the
following values:

* `failover`: The URLs specified are used in the order that they are specified.
The first server that can be connected to will be used for all subsequent
connections. If a connection to that server fails then the next server that a
connection can be established to will be used for subsequent connections.
* `dns_failover`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be specified.
This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all IP
addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections to the Active Directory
or LDAP server will always be tried in the order in which they were retrieved.
This differs from `failover` in that there is no reordering of the list and if a
server has failed at the beginning of the list, it will still be tried for each
subsequent connection.
* `round_robin`: Connections will continuously iterate through the list of
provided URLs. If a server is unavailable, iterating through the list of URLs
will continue until a successful connection is made.
* `dns_round_robin`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be
specified. This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all
IP addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections will continuously
iterate through the list of addresses. If a server is unavailable, iterating
through the list of URLs will continue until a successful connection is made.

[[ssl-tls-settings]]
==== General TLS settings
`xpack.security.ssl.diagnose.trust`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
Controls whether to output diagnostic messages for SSL/TLS trust failures.
If this is `true` (the default), a message will be printed to the Elasticsearch
log whenever an SSL connection (incoming or outgoing) is rejected due to a failure
to establish trust.
This diagnostic message contains information that can be used to determine the
cause of the failure and assist with resolving the problem.
Set to `false` to disable these messages.
NOTE: This defaults to `false` when `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is `true`.

[discrete]
[[tls-ssl-key-settings]]
===== TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the
trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS
connection. If no trusted certificates are configured, the default certificates
that are trusted by the JVM will be trusted along with the certificate(s)
associated with a key in the same context. The key and certificate must be in
place for connections that require client authentication or when acting as a
SSL enabled server.

[[pkcs12-truststore-note]]
[NOTE]
Storing trusted certificates in a PKCS#12 file, although supported, is
uncommon in practice. The <<certutil,`elasticsearch-certutil` tool>>,
as well as Java's `keytool`, are designed to generate PKCS#12 files that
can be used both as a keystore and as a truststore, but this may not be the
case for container files that are created using other tools. Usually,
PKCS#12 files only contain secret and private entries. To confirm that
a PKCS#12 container includes trusted certificate ("anchor") entries look for
`2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1: <Unsupported tag 6>` in the
`openssl pkcs12 -info` output, or `trustedCertEntry` in the
`keytool -list` output.

[[ssl-tls-profile-settings]]
[discrete]
===== Transport profile TLS/SSL settings
The same settings that are available for the <<transport-tls-ssl-settings, default transport>>
are also available for each transport profile. By default, the settings for a
transport profile will be the same as the default transport unless they
are specified.

As an example, lets look at the key setting. For the default transport
this is `xpack.security.transport.ssl.key`. In order to use this setting in a
transport profile, use the prefix `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.` and
append the portion of the setting after `xpack.security.transport.`. For the key
setting, this would be `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.ssl.key`.

(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
List of IP addresses to allow.

`xpack.security.transport.filter.deny`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
List of IP addresses to deny.

(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
List of IP addresses to allow just for HTTP.

`xpack.security.http.filter.deny`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
List of IP addresses to deny just for HTTP.

`transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.filter.allow`::
(<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)

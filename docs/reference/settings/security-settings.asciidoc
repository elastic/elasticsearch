[[security-settings]]
=== Security settings in {es}
++++
<titleabbrev>Security settings</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, the {es} {security-features} are disabled when you have a basic or
trial license. To enable {security-features}, use the `xpack.security.enabled`
setting.

You configure `xpack.security` settings  to
<<anonymous-access-settings, enable anonymous access>>
and perform message authentication,
<<field-document-security-settings, set up document and field level security>>,
<<realm-settings, configure realms>>,
<<ssl-tls-settings, encrypt communications with SSL>>, and
<<auditing-settings, audit security events>>.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {es} keystore.
For more information about creating and updating the {es} keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>.

[float]
[[general-security-settings]]
==== General security settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` to enable {es} {security-features} on the node. +
+
--
If set to `false`, which is the default value for basic and trial licenses,
{security-features} are disabled. It also affects all {kib} instances that
connect to this {es} instance; you do not need to disable {security-features} in
those `kibana.yml` files. For more information about disabling {security-features}
in specific {kib} instances, see
{kibana-ref}/security-settings-kb.html[{kib} security settings].

TIP: If you have gold or higher licenses, the default value is `true`; we 
recommend that you explicitly add this setting to avoid confusion.  

--

`xpack.security.hide_settings`::
A comma-separated list of settings that are omitted from the results of the
<<cluster-nodes-info,cluster nodes info API>>. You can use wildcards to include
multiple settings in the list.  For example, the following value hides all the
settings for the ad1 active_directory realm:
`xpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.ad1.*`.
The API already omits all `ssl` settings, `bind_dn`, and `bind_password` due to
the sensitive nature of the information.

`xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled`::
Enables fips mode of operation. Set this to `true` if you run this {es} instance in a FIPS 140-2 enabled JVM.  For more information, see <<fips-140-compliance>>. Defaults to `false`.

[float]
[[password-hashing-settings]]
==== Password hashing settings
`xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm`::
Specifies the hashing algorithm that is used for secure user credential storage. 
See <<password-hashing-algorithms>>. Defaults to `bcrypt`.

[float]
[[anonymous-access-settings]]
==== Anonymous access settings
You can configure the following anonymous access settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.  For more information, see {stack-ov}/anonymous-access.html[
Enabling anonymous access].

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.username`::

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.roles`::
The roles to associate with the anonymous user. Required.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.authz_exception`::
When `true`, an HTTP 403 response is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the appropriate permissions for the requested action. The
user is not prompted to provide credentials to access the requested
resource. When set to `false`, an HTTP 401 response is returned and the user
can provide credentials with the appropriate permissions to gain
access. Defaults to `true`.

[float]
[[security-automata-settings]]
==== Automata Settings
In places where the {security-features} accept wildcard patterns (e.g. index
patterns in roles, group matches in the role mapping API), each pattern is
compiled into an Automaton. The follow settings are available to control this
behaviour.

`xpack.security.automata.max_determinized_states`::
The upper limit on how many automaton states may be created by a single pattern.
This protects against too-difficult (e.g. exponentially hard) patterns.
Defaults to `100,000`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.enabled`::
Whether to cache the compiled automata. Compiling automata can be CPU intensive
and may slowdown some operations. The cache reduces the frequency with which
automata need to be compiled.
Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.size`::
The maximum number of items to retain in the automata cache.
Defaults to `10,000`.

`xpack.security.automata.cache.ttl`::
The length of time to retain in an item in the automata cache (based on most
recent usage).
Defaults to `48h` (48 hours).

[float]
[[field-document-security-settings]]
==== Document and field level security settings

You can set the following document and field level security
settings in `elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see

Set to `false` to prevent document and field level security
from being configured. Defaults to `true`.

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.ttl`::
The time-to-live for cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to expire entries that are
unused for `168h` (7 days).

`xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.size`::
The maximum memory usage of cached `BitSet` entries for document level security.
Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are
automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to `50mb`, after which 
least-recently-used entries will be evicted.

[float]
[[token-service-settings]]
==== Token service settings

You can set the following token service settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.

`xpack.security.authc.token.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable the built-in token service. Defaults to `true` unless
 `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is `false`. This prevents sniffing the token
  from a connection over plain http.

`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout`::
The length of time that a token is valid for. By default this value is `20m` or
20 minutes. The maximum value is 1 hour.

The default filter looks up `user` objects with
a matching `userPrincipalName`. If specified, this
must be a valid LDAP user search filter. For example,
`(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={1}))`. `{1}` is the full user principal name
provided by the user. For more information, see 
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx[Search Filter Syntax].

`user_search.down_level_filter`::

===== OpenID Connect realm SSL settings

The following settings can be used to configure SSL for all outgoing http connections
to the OpenID Connect Provider endpoints.

NOTE: These settings are _only_ used for the back-channel communication between
{es} and the OpenID Connect Provider

`ssl.key`::
Specifies the path to the PEM encoded private key to use for http client
authentication (if required). `ssl.key` and `ssl.keystore.path` cannot be used
at the same time.

`ssl.key_passphrase`::
Specifies the passphrase to decrypt the PEM encoded private key (`ssl.key`) if it is
encrypted. Cannot be used with `ssl.secure_key_passphrase`.

`ssl.secure_key_passphrase` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Specifies the passphrase to decrypt the PEM encoded private key (`ssl.key`) if it is
encrypted. Cannot be used with `ssl.key_passphrase`.

`ssl.certificate`::
Specifies the path to the PEM encoded certificate (or certificate chain) that is associated
with the key (`ssl.key`). This setting can be used only if `ssl.key` is set.

`ssl.certificate_authorities`::
Specifies the paths to the PEM encoded certificate authority certificates that should be
trusted. `ssl.certificate_authorities` and `ssl.truststore.path` cannot be
used at the same time.

`ssl.keystore.path`::
Specifies the path to the keystore that contains a private key and certificate.
Must be either a Java Keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file.
`ssl.key` and `ssl.keystore.path` cannot be used at the same time.

`ssl.keystore.type`::
The type of the keystore (`ssl.keystore.path`). Must be either `jks` or `PKCS12`.
If the keystore path ends in ".p12", ".pfx" or "pkcs12", this setting defaults
to `PKCS12`. Otherwise, it defaults to `jks`.

`ssl.keystore.password`::
The password to the keystore (`ssl.keystore.path`). This setting cannot be used
with `ssl.keystore.secure_password`.

`ssl.keystore.secure_password` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
The password to the keystore (`ssl.keystore.path`).
This setting cannot be used with `ssl.keystore.password`.

`ssl.keystore.key_password`::
The password for the key in the keystore (`ssl.keystore.path`).
Defaults to the keystore password. This setting cannot be used with
`ssl.keystore.secure_key_password`.

`ssl.keystore.secure_key_password` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
The password for the key in the keystore (`ssl.keystore.path`).
Defaults to the keystore password. This setting cannot be used with
`ssl.keystore.key_password`.

`ssl.truststore.path`::
The path to the keystore that contains the certificates to trust.
Must be either a Java Keystore (jks) or a PKCS#12 file.
`ssl.certificate_authorities` and `ssl.truststore.path` cannot be used at the
same time.

`ssl.truststore.type`::
The type of the truststore (`ssl.truststore.path`). Must be either `jks` or
`PKCS12`. If the keystore path ends in ".p12", ".pfx" or "pkcs12", this setting
defaults to `PKCS12`. Otherwise, it defaults to `jks`.

`ssl.truststore.password`::
The password to the truststore (`ssl.truststore.path`). This setting cannot be
used with `ssl.truststore.secure_password`.

`ssl.truststore.secure_password` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
The password to the truststore (`ssl.truststore.path`). This setting cannot be
used with `ssl.truststore.password`.

`ssl.verification_mode`::
One of `full` (verify the hostname and the certificate path), `certificate` (verify the
certificate path, but not the hostname) or `none` (perform no verification).
Defaults to `full`.
+
See <<ssl-tls-settings,`ssl.verification_mode`>> for a more detailed explanation of these values.

`ssl.supported_protocols`::
Specifies the supported protocols for TLS/SSL. Defaults to `TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1` if
the JVM supports TLSv1.3, otherwise `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1`.

`ssl.cipher_suites`::
Specifies the cipher suites that should be supported.

[[load-balancing]]
===== Load balancing and failover

The `load_balance.type` setting can have the following values: 

* `failover`: The URLs specified are used in the order that they are specified. 
The first server that can be connected to will be used for all subsequent 
connections. If a connection to that server fails then the next server that a 
connection can be established to will be used for subsequent connections.
* `dns_failover`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be specified.
This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all IP 
addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections to the Active Directory 
or LDAP server will always be tried in the order in which they were retrieved. 
This differs from `failover` in that there is no reordering of the list and if a 
server has failed at the beginning of the list, it will still be tried for each 
subsequent connection.
* `round_robin`: Connections will continuously iterate through the list of 
provided URLs. If a server is unavailable, iterating through the list of URLs 
will continue until a successful connection is made.
* `dns_round_robin`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be 
specified. This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all 
IP addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections will continuously 
iterate through the list of addresses. If a server is unavailable, iterating 
through the list of URLs will continue until a successful connection is made.

[[ssl-tls-settings]]
==== Default values for TLS/SSL settings
In general, the values below represent the default values for the various TLS
settings.
The prefixes for these settings are based on the context in which they are
used (e.g. `xpack.security.authc.realms.ldap.corp_ldap.ssl.verification_mode`
or `xpack.security.transport.ssl.supported_protocols`).

For more information, see
{stack-ov}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting communications].

`*.ssl.supported_protocols`::
Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols: `SSLv2Hello`,
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`. Defaults to `TLSv1.3,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1`.
+
--
NOTE: If `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` is `true`, you cannot use `SSLv2Hello` 
or `SSLv3`. See <<fips-140-compliance>>.
--

`*.ssl.client_authentication`::
Controls the server's behavior in regard to requesting a certificate
from client connections. Valid values are `required`, `optional`, and `none`.
`required` forces a client to present a certificate, while `optional`
requests a client certificate but the client is not required to present one.
Defaults to `required`, except for HTTP, which defaults to `none`. See
 <<http-tls-ssl-settings>>.

`*.ssl.verification_mode`::
Controls the verification of certificates. Valid values are:
- `full`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
       authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP
       address) matches the names identified within the certificate.
- `certificate`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
       trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
- `none`, which performs _no verification_ of the server's certificate. This mode
       disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be
       used after very careful consideration. It is primarily intended as a
       temporary diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors,
       and its use on production clusters is strongly discouraged.
+
The default value is `full`.

`*.ssl.cipher_suites`::
Supported cipher suites can be found in Oracle's
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/oracle-providers.html#GUID-7093246A-31A3-4304-AC5F-5FB6400405E2[Java Cryptography Architecture documentation].
Defaults to `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`,
`TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`.

[float]
[[tls-ssl-key-settings]]
===== TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the
trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS
connection. If no trusted certificates are configured, the default certificates
that are trusted by the JVM will be trusted along with the certificate(s)
associated with a key in the same context. The key and certificate must be in
place for connections that require client authentication or when acting as a
SSL enabled server.

[[pkcs12-truststore-note]]
[NOTE]
Storing trusted certificates in a PKCS#12 file, although supported, is
uncommon in practice. The {ref}/certutil.html[`elasticsearch-certutil`] tool,
as well as Java's `keytool`, are designed to generate PKCS#12 files that
can be used both as a keystore and as a truststore, but this may not be the
case for container files that are created using other tools. Usually,
PKCS#12 files only contain secret and private entries. To confirm that
a PKCS#12 container includes trusted certificate ("anchor") entries look for
`2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1: <Unsupported tag 6>` in the
`openssl pkcs12 -info` output, or `trustedCertEntry` in the
`keytool -list` output.

[[ssl-tls-profile-settings]]
[float]
===== Transport profile TLS/SSL settings
The same settings that are available for the <<transport-tls-ssl-settings, default transport>>
are also available for each transport profile. By default, the settings for a
transport profile will be the same as the default transport unless they
are specified.

As an example, lets look at the key setting. For the default transport
this is `xpack.security.transport.ssl.key`. In order to use this setting in a
transport profile, use the prefix `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.` and
append the portion of the setting after `xpack.security.transport.`. For the key
setting, this would be `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.ssl.key`.

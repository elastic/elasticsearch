You do not need to configure any settings to use {transforms}. It is enabled by
default.

==== General {transforms} settings

`node.roles: [ transform ]`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) Set `node.roles` to contain `transform` to
identify the node as a _transform node_. If you want to run {transforms}, there
must be at least one {transform} node in your cluster.
+
If you set `node.roles`, you must explicitly specify all the required roles for
the node. To learn more, refer to <<modules-node>>.
+
IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that dedicated {transform} nodes also have
the `remote_cluster_client` role; otherwise, {ccs} fails when used in
{transforms}. See <<remote-node>>.

`xpack.transform.enabled`::
deprecated:[7.8.0,Basic License features should always be enabled]
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) This deprecated setting no longer has any
effect.

`xpack.transform.num_transform_failure_retries`::
(<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>) The number of times that a {transform}
retries when it experiences a non-fatal error. Once the number of retries is
exhausted, the {transform} task is marked as `failed`. The default value is `10`
with a valid minimum of `0` and maximum of `100`. If a {transform} is already
running, it has to be restarted to use the changed setting.
The `num_failure_retries` setting can also be specified on an individual {transform} level.
Specifying this setting for each {transform} individually is recommended.

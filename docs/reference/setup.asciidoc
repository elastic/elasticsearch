[[setup]]
= Set up {es}

This section includes information on how to setup Elasticsearch and get it
running, including:

* Downloading
* Installing
* Starting
* Configuring

[[supported-platforms]]
[discrete]
== Supported platforms

The matrix of officially supported operating systems and JVMs is available here:
link:/support/matrix[Support Matrix]. Elasticsearch is tested on the listed
platforms, but it is possible that it will work on other platforms too.

[discrete]
[[dedicated-host]]
== Use dedicated hosts

In production, we recommend you run {es} on a dedicated host or as a primary
service. Several {es} features, such as automatic JVM heap sizing, assume it's
the only resource-intensive application on the host or container. For example,
you might run {metricbeat} alongside {es} for cluster statistics, but a
resource-heavy {ls} deployment should be on its own host.

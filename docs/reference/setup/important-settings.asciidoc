=== Important {es} configuration

{es} requires very little configuration to get started, but there are a number
of items which *must* be considered before using your cluster in production:

* <<path-settings,Path settings>>
* <<cluster-name,Cluster name setting>>
* <<node-name,Node name setting>>
* <<network.host,Network host settings>>
* <<discovery-settings,Discovery settings>>
* <<heap-size-settings,Heap size settings>>
* <<heap-dump-path,JVM heap dump path setting>>
* <<gc-logging,GC logging settings>>
* <<es-tmpdir,Temporary directory settings>>
* <<error-file-path,JVM fatal error log setting>>
* <<important-settings-backups,Cluster backups>>

Our {ess-trial}[{ecloud}] service configures these items automatically, making
your cluster production-ready by default.

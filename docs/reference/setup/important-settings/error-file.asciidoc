==== JVM fatal error log setting

By default, {es} configures the JVM to write fatal error logs
to the default logging directory. On <<rpm,RPM>> and <<deb,Debian>> packages,
this directory is `/var/log/elasticsearch`. On <<targz,Linux and MacOS>> and <<zip-windows,Windows>> distributions, the `logs`
directory is located under the root of the {es} installation.

These are logs produced by the JVM when it encounters a fatal error, such as a
segmentation fault. If this path is not suitable for receiving logs,
modify the `-XX:ErrorFile=...` entry in <<set-jvm-options,`jvm.options`>>.

[[hosted-elasticsearch-service]]
=== Hosted Elasticsearch Service

{ecloud} offers all of the features of {es}, {kib}, and  Elasticâ€™s {observability}, {ents}, and {elastic-sec} solutions as a hosted service 
available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. 

To set up Elasticsearch in {ecloud}, sign up for a {ess-trial}[free {ecloud} trial].

[[elasticsearch-deployment-options]]
=== Self-managed {es} options

If you want to install and manage {es} yourself, you can:

* Run {es} using a <<elasticsearch-install-packages,Linux, MacOS, or Windows install package>>.
* Run {es} in a <<elasticsearch-docker-images,Docker container>>. 
* Set up and manage {es}, {kib}, {agent}, and the rest of the Elastic Stack on Kubernetes with {eck-ref}[{eck}].

TIP: To try out Elasticsearch on your own machine, we recommend using Docker and running both Elasticsearch and Kibana. For more information, see <<run-elasticsearch-locally,Run Elasticsearch locally>>.

[[elasticsearch-install-packages]]
=== Elasticsearch install packages

Elasticsearch is provided in the following package formats:

[horizontal]
Linux and MacOS `tar.gz` archives::

The `tar.gz` archives are available for installation on any Linux distribution and MacOS.
+
<<targz>>

Windows `.zip` archive::

The `zip` archive is suitable for installation on Windows.
+
<<zip-windows>>

`deb`::

The `deb` package is suitable for Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based
systems. Debian packages may be downloaded from the Elasticsearch website or
from our Debian repository.
+
<<deb>>

`rpm`::

The `rpm` package is suitable for installation on Red Hat, Centos, SLES,
OpenSuSE and other RPM-based systems. RPMs may be downloaded from the
Elasticsearch website or from our RPM repository.
+
<<rpm>>

TIP: For a step-by-step example of setting up the {stack} on your own premises, try out our tutorial: {stack-ref}/installing-stack-demo-self.html[Installing a self-managed Elastic Stack].

[discrete]
[[elasticsearch-docker-images]]
=== Elasticsearch container images

You can also run {es} inside a container image.

[horizontal]
`docker`::

Docker container images may be downloaded from the Elastic Docker Registry.

[[jvm-version]]
=== Java (JVM) Version

{es} is built using Java, and includes a bundled version of
https://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK] from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE) within
each distribution. The bundled JVM is the recommended JVM.

To use your own version of Java, set the `ES_JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
If you must use a version of Java that is different from the bundled JVM, it is
best to use the latest release of a link:/support/matrix[supported]
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html[LTS version of Java].
{es} is closely coupled to certain OpenJDK-specific features, so it may not
work correctly with other JVMs. {es} will refuse to start if a known-bad
version of Java is used.

If you use a JVM other than the bundled one, you are responsible for reacting
to announcements related to its security issues and bug fixes, and must
yourself determine whether each update is necessary or not. In contrast, the
bundled JVM is treated as an integral part of {es}, which means that Elastic
takes responsibility for keeping it up to date. Security issues and bugs within
the bundled JVM are treated as if they were within {es} itself.

The bundled JVM is located within the `jdk` subdirectory of the {es} home
directory. You may remove this directory if using your own JVM.

[discrete]
[[jvm-agents]]
=== JVM and Java agents

Don't use third-party Java agents that attach to the JVM. These agents
can reduce {es} performance, including freezing or crashing nodes.

[[jvm-version]]
=== Java (JVM) Version

{es} is built using Java, and includes a bundled version of
https://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK] from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE) within
each distribution. The bundled JVM is the recommended JVM.

To use your own version of Java, set the `ES_JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
If you must use a version of Java that is different from the bundled JVM, it is
best to use the latest release of a link:/support/matrix[supported]
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html[LTS version of Java].
{es} is closely coupled to certain OpenJDK-specific features, so it may not
work correctly with other JVMs. {es} will refuse to start if a known-bad
version of Java is used.

If you use a JVM other than the bundled one, you are responsible for reacting
to announcements related to its security issues and bug fixes, and must
yourself determine whether each update is necessary or not. In contrast, the
bundled JVM is treated as an integral part of {es}, which means that Elastic
takes responsibility for keeping it up to date. Security issues and bugs within
the bundled JVM are treated as if they were within {es} itself.

The bundled JVM is located within the `jdk` subdirectory of the {es} home
directory. You may remove this directory if using your own JVM.

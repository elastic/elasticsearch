[[deb]]
=== Install Elasticsearch with Debian Package

The Debian package for Elasticsearch can be <<install-rpm,downloaded from our website>>
or from our  <<deb-repo,APT repository>>. It can be used to install
Elasticsearch on any Debian-based system such as Debian and Ubuntu.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download Elasticsearch] page. Other versions can
be found on the link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

[[deb-key]]
==== Import the Elasticsearch PGP Key

include::key.asciidoc[]

[source,sh]
-------------------------
wget -qO - https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
-------------------------

[[deb-repo]]
==== Installing from the APT repository

You may need to install the `apt-transport-https` package on Debian before proceeding:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
--------------------------------------------------

Save the repository definition to  +/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-{major-version}.list+:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
echo "deb https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/{major-version}/debian stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-{major-version}.list
--------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
==================================================

Do not use `add-apt-repository` as it will add a `deb-src` entry as well, but
we do not provide a source package. If you have added the `deb-src` entry, you
will see an error like the following:

    Unable to find expected entry 'main/source/Sources' in Release file
    (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

Delete the `deb-src` entry from the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and the
installation should work as expected.
==================================================

You can install the Elasticsearch Debian package with:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
==================================================
If two entries exist for the same Elasticsearch repository, you will see an error like this during `apt-get update`:

["literal",subs="attributes,callouts"]

Duplicate sources.list entry https://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/{major-version}/debian/ ...`

Examine +/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-{major-version}.list+ for the duplicate entry or locate the duplicate entry amongst the files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` and the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.
==================================================


[[install-deb]]
==== Download and install the Debian package manually

The Debian package for Elastisearch v{version} can be downloaded from the website and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.deb
sha1sum elasticsearch-{version}.deb <1>
sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-{version}.deb
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compare the SHA produced by `sha1sum` or `shasum` with the
    https://download.elastics.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.deb.sha1[published SHA].

[[deb-running-init]]
==== Running Elasticsearch with SysV `init`

Use the `update-rc.d` command to configure Elasticsearch to start automatically
when the system boots up:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10
--------------------------------------------------

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the `service` command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo -i service elasticsearch start
sudo -i service elasticsearch stop
--------------------------------------------

If Elasticsearch fails to start for any reason, it will print the reason for
failure to STDOUT. Log files can be found in `/var/log/elasticsearch/`.

[[deb-configuring]]
==== Configuring Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

The Debian package also has a system configuration file (`/etc/default/elasticsearch`),
which allows you to set the following parameters:

include::sysconfig-file.asciidoc[]

NOTE: Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be
configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`
file.  See <<systemd>> for more information.

[[deb-layout]]
==== Directory layout of Debian package

The Debian package places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate
locations for a Debian-based system:

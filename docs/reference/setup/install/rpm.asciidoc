[[rpm]]
=== Install Elasticsearch with RPM

The RPM for Elasticsearch can be <<install-rpm,downloaded from our website>>
or from our  <<rpm-repo,RPM repository>>. It can be used to install
Elasticsearch on any RPM-based system such as OpenSuSE, SLES, Centos, Red Hat,
and Oracle Enterprise.

NOTE: RPM install is not supported on distributions with old versions of RPM,
such as SLES 11 and CentOS 5. Please see <<targz>> instead.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download Elasticsearch] page. Other versions can
be found on the link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

NOTE: Elasticsearch includes a bundled version of https://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK]
from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE). To use your own version of Java,
see the <<jvm-version, JVM version requirements>>

TIP: For a step-by-step example of setting up the {stack} on your own premises, try out our tutorial: {stack-ref}/installing-stack-demo-self.html[Installing a self-managed Elastic Stack].

[[rpm-key]]
==== Import the Elasticsearch GPG Key

include::key.asciidoc[]

[source,sh]
-------------------------
rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
-------------------------

[[rpm-repo]]
==== Installing from the RPM repository

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

WARNING: Version {version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

Create a file called `elasticsearch.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory
for RedHat based distributions, or in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` directory for
OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="released"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[elasticsearch]
name=Elasticsearch repository for {major-version} packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/{major-version}/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=0
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
--------------------------------------------------

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="prerelease"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[elasticsearch]
name=Elasticsearch repository for {major-version} packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/{major-version}-prerelease/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=0
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
--------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

And your repository is ready for use. You can now install Elasticsearch with one of the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch <1>
sudo dnf install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch <2>
sudo zypper modifyrepo --enable elasticsearch && \
  sudo zypper install elasticsearch; \
  sudo zypper modifyrepo --disable elasticsearch <3>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Use `yum` on CentOS and older Red Hat based distributions.
<2> Use `dnf` on Fedora and other newer Red Hat distributions.
<3> Use `zypper` on OpenSUSE based distributions

NOTE: The configured repository is disabled by default. This eliminates the possibility of accidentally
upgrading `elasticsearch` when upgrading the rest of the system. Each install or upgrade command
must explicitly enable the repository as indicated in the sample commands above.

endif::[]

[[install-rpm]]
==== Download and install the RPM manually

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

WARNING: Version {version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

The RPM for Elasticsearch v{version} can be downloaded from the website and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}-x86_64.rpm
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}-x86_64.rpm.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{version}-x86_64.rpm.sha512 <1>
sudo rpm --install elasticsearch-{version}-x86_64.rpm
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compares the SHA of the downloaded RPM and the published checksum, which should output
    `elasticsearch-{version}-x86_64.rpm: OK`.

[[rpm-configuring]]
==== Configuring Elasticsearch

include::etc-elasticsearch.asciidoc[]

The RPM also has a system configuration file (`/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`),
which allows you to set the following parameters:

include::sysconfig-file.asciidoc[]

NOTE: Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be
configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`
file. See <<systemd>> for more information.

[[rpm-layout]]
==== Directory layout of RPM

The RPM places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate
locations for an RPM-based system:

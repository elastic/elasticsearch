[horizontal]
`ES_USER`::

  The user to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`.

`ES_GROUP`::

  The group to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`.

`JAVA_HOME`::

  Set a custom Java path to be used.

`MAX_OPEN_FILES`::

    Maximum number of open files, defaults to `65536`.

`MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY`::

    Maximum locked memory size. Set to `unlimited if you use the
    `bootstrap.memory_lock` option in elasticsearch.yml.

`MAX_MAP_COUNT`::

    Maximum number of memory map areas a process may have. If you use `mmapfs`
    as index store type, make sure this is set to a high value. For more
    information, check the
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt[linux kernel documentation]
    about `max_map_count`. This is set via `sysctl` before starting
    elasticsearch. Defaults to `262144`.

`LOG_DIR`::

    Log directory, defaults to `/var/log/elasticsearch`.

`DATA_DIR`::

    Data directory, defaults to `/var/lib/elasticsearch`.

`CONF_DIR`::

    Configuration file directory (which needs to include `elasticsearch.yml`
    and `logging.yml` files), defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`.

`ES_JAVA_OPTS`::

    Any additional JVM system properties you may want to apply.

`RESTART_ON_UPGRADE`::

    Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you
    will have to restart your elasticsearch instance after installing a
    package manually. The reason for this is to ensure, that upgrades in a
    cluster do not result in a continuous shard reallocation resulting in high
    network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster.

==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

[IMPORTANT]
.macOS Gatekeeper warnings
====
Apple's rollout of stricter notarization requirements affected the notarization
of the {version} {es} artifacts. If macOS Catalina displays a dialog when you
first run {es} that interrupts it, you will need to take an action to allow it
to run.

To prevent Gatekeeper checks on the {es} files, run the following command on the
downloaded `.tar.gz` archive or the directory to which was extracted:

[source,sh]
----
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <archive-or-directory>
----

For example, if the `.tar.gz` file was extracted to the default
elasticsearch-{version} directory, the command is:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine elasticsearch-{version}
----

Alternatively, you can add a security override for both `jdk.app` and
`controller.app` by following the instructions in the _How to open an app that
hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer_ section of
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491[Safely open apps on your Mac].
====

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the
standard output (`stdout`), and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

NOTE: All scripts packaged with Elasticsearch require a version of Bash
that supports arrays and assume that Bash is available at `/bin/bash`.
As such, Bash should be available at this path either directly or via a
symbolic link.

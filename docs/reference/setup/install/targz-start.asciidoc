==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------

If you have password-protected the {es} keystore, you will be prompted
to enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more
details.

By default {es} prints its logs to the console (`stdout`) and also to the
`<cluster name>.log` file within the <<path-settings,logs directory>>. It will
record some information in the logs while it is starting up but once it has
finished initializing it will continue to run in the foreground but won't log
anything further until something happens that is worth recording. From now on
you can interact with {es} using its HTTP interface, which is on port 9200 by
default. You can stop it by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

NOTE: All scripts packaged with Elasticsearch require a version of Bash
that supports arrays and assume that Bash is available at `/bin/bash`.
As such, Bash should be available at this path either directly or via a
symbolic link.

[[targz-configuring]]
==== Configure {es} on the command line

{es} loads its configuration from the `$ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`
file by default. The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

Any settings that can be specified in the config file can also be specified on
the command line, using the `-E` syntax as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch -d -Ecluster.name=my_cluster -Enode.name=node_1
--------------------------------------------

TIP: Typically, any cluster-wide settings (like `cluster.name`) should be
added to the `elasticsearch.yml` config file, while any node-specific settings
such as `node.name` could be specified on the command line.

[[targz-layout]]
==== Directory layout of archives

The archive distributions are entirely self-contained. All files and
directories are, by default, contained within `$ES_HOME` -- the directory
created when unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using {es}, and uninstalling {es} is as easy as
removing the `$ES_HOME` directory. However, it is advisable to change the
default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs
directory so that you do not delete important data later on.

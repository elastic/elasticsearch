=== Install Elasticsearch with `.zip` or `.tar.gz`

Elasticsearch is provided as a `.zip` and as a `.tar.gz` package.  These
packages can be used to install Elasticsearch on any system and are the
easiest package format to use when trying out Elasticsearch.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download Elasticsearch] page.
Other versions can be found on the
link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

[[install-zip]]
==== Download and install the `.zip` package

The `.zip` archive for Elastisearch v{version} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/zip/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.zip
sha1sum elasticsearch-{version}.zip <1>
unzip elasticsearch-{version}.zip
cd elasticsearch-{version}/ <2>
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compare the SHA produced by `sha1sum` or `shasum` with the
    https://download.elastics.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/zip/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.zip.sha1[published SHA].
<2> This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.

[[install-targz]]
==== Download and install the `.tar.gz` package

The `.tar.gz` archive for Elastisearch v{version} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/tar/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.tar.gz
sha1sum elasticsearch-{version}.tar.gz <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{version}.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{version}/ <2>
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compare the SHA produced by `sha1sum` or `shasum` with the
    https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/tar/elasticsearch/{version}/elasticsearch-{version}.tar.gz.sha1[published SHA].
<2> This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.

[[zip-targz-running]]
==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to `STDOUT`,
and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

[[setup-installation-daemon]]
==== Running as a daemon

To run Elasticsearch as a daemon, specify `-d` on the command line, and record
the process ID in a file using the `-p` option:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid
--------------------------------------------

Log messages can be found in the `$ES_HOME/logs/` directory.

To shut down Elasticsearch, kill the process ID recorded in the `pid` file:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
kill `cat pid`
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: The startup scripts provided in the <<rpm,RPM>> and <<deb,Debian>>
packages take care of starting and stopping the Elasticsearch process for you.

[[zip-targz-configuring]]
==== Configuring Elasticsearch on the command line

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the `$ES_HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`
file by default.  The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

Any settings that can be specified in the config file can also be specified on
the command line, using the `-E` syntax as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch -d -Ecluster.name=my_cluster -Enode.name=node_1
--------------------------------------------

TIP: Typically, any cluster-wide settings (like `cluster.name`) should be
added to the `elasticsearch.yml` config file, while any node-specific settings
such as `node.name` could be specified on the command line.

[[zip-targz-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.zip` and `.tar.gz` archives

The `.zip` and `.tar.gz` packages are entirely self-contained. All files and
directories are, by default, contained within `$ES_HOME` -- the directory
created when unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using Elasticsearch, and uninstalling Elasticsearch is as easy as
removing the `$ES_HOME` directory.  However, it is advisable to change the
default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs
directory so that you do not delete important data later on.

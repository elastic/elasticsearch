=== Install {es} with `.zip` on Windows

{es} can be installed on Windows using the Windows `.zip` archive. This
comes with a `elasticsearch-service.bat` command which will setup {es} to run as a
service.

NOTE: On Windows the {es} {ml} feature requires the Microsoft Universal
C Runtime library. This is built into Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 and more
recent versions of Windows. For older versions of Windows it can be installed
via Windows Update, or from a
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows[separate download].
If you cannot install the Microsoft Universal C Runtime library you can still
use the rest of {es} if you disable the {ml} feature.

The latest stable version of {es} can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download {es}] page.
Other versions can be found on the
link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

NOTE: {es} includes a bundled version of https://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK]
from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE). To use your own version of Java,
see the <<jvm-version, JVM version requirements>>

==== Download and install the `.zip` package

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

WARNING: Version {version} of {es} has not yet been released.

endif::[]

Download the `.zip` archive for {es} {version} from: https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}-windows-x86_64.zip

Unzip it with your favorite unzip tool. This will create a folder called
+elasticsearch-{version}+, which we will refer to as `%ES_HOME%`. In a terminal
window, `cd` to the `%ES_HOME%` directory, for instance:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------
cd C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{version}

[[windows-configuring]]
==== Configure {es} on the command line

{es} loads its configuration from the `%ES_HOME%\config\elasticsearch.yml`
file by default. The format of this config file is explained in
<<settings>>.

Any settings that can be specified in the config file can also be specified on
the command line, using the `-E` syntax as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat -Ecluster.name=my_cluster -Enode.name=node_1
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: Values that contain spaces must be surrounded with quotes. For instance `-Epath.logs="C:\My Logs\logs"`.

TIP: Typically, any cluster-wide settings (like `cluster.name`) should be
added to the `elasticsearch.yml` config file, while any node-specific settings
such as `node.name` could be specified on the command line.

[[windows-service]]
==== Install and run {es} as a service on Windows

You can install {es} as a service that runs in the background or starts
automatically at boot time without user interaction.

. Install {es} as a service. The name of the service and the value of
`ES_JAVA_HOME` will be made available during install:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{version}{backslash}bin>elasticsearch-service.bat install
Installing service      :  "elasticsearch-service-x64"
Using ES_JAVA_HOME (64-bit):  "C:\jvm\jdk1.8"
The service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' has been installed.
----

. Start {es} as a service. When {es} starts, authentication is enabled by
default:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{version}{backslash}bin>bin\elasticsearch-service.bat start
----
+
NOTE: TLS is not enabled or configured when you start {es} as a service.

. Generate a password for the `elastic` user with the
<<reset-password,`elasticsearch-reset-password`>> tool. The password is output
to the command line.
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{version}{backslash}bin>\bin\elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
----

NOTE: While a JRE can be used for the {es} service, due to its use of a client
VM (as opposed to a server JVM which offers better performance for long-running
applications) its usage is discouraged and a warning will be issued.

NOTE: The system environment variable `ES_JAVA_HOME` should be set to the path
of the JDK installation that you want the service to use. If you upgrade the
JDK, you are not required to the reinstall the service but you must set the
value of the system environment variable `ES_JAVA_HOME` to the path to the new
JDK installation. However, upgrading across JVM types (e.g. JRE versus SE) is
not supported, and does require the service to be reinstalled.

[[windows-service-manage]]
===== Manage {es} as a service on Windows

Run the `elasticsearch-service.bat` script in the `bin\` folder to install,
remove, manage, or configure the service and potentially start and stop the
service from the command line.

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----
C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-{version}{backslash}bin>elasticsearch-service.bat

Usage: elasticsearch-service.bat install|remove|start|stop|manager [SERVICE_ID]
----

The script requires one parameter (the command to execute), followed by an
optional one indicating the service id (useful when installing multiple
{es} services).

The commands available are:
--
[horizontal]
`install`:: Install {es} as a service

`remove`:: Remove the installed {es} service (and stop the service if started)

`start`:: Start the {es} service (if installed)

`stop`:: Stop the {es} service (if started)

`manager`:: Start a GUI for managing the installed service
--

[[windows-service-settings]]
[discrete]
=== Customize service settings

The {es} service can be configured prior to installation by setting the following environment variables (either using the https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754250(v=ws.10).aspx[set command] from the command line, or through the *System Properties->Environment Variables* GUI).

[horizontal]
`SERVICE_ID`::

  A unique identifier for the service. Useful if installing multiple instances
  on the same machine. Defaults to `elasticsearch-service-x64`.

`SERVICE_USERNAME`::

  The user to run as, defaults to the local system account.

`SERVICE_PASSWORD`::

  The password for the user specified in `%SERVICE_USERNAME%`.

`SERVICE_DISPLAY_NAME`::

  The name of the service. Defaults to `{es} <version> %SERVICE_ID%`.

`SERVICE_DESCRIPTION`::

  The description of the service. Defaults to `{es} <version> Windows Service - https://elastic.co`.

`ES_JAVA_HOME`::

  The installation directory of the desired JVM to run the service under.

`SERVICE_LOG_DIR`::

    Service log directory, defaults to `%ES_HOME%\logs`. Note that this does
    not control the path for the {es} logs; the path for these is set
    via the setting `path.logs` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
    or on the command line.

`ES_PATH_CONF`::

    Configuration file directory (which needs to include `elasticsearch.yml`,
    `jvm.options`, and `log4j2.properties` files), defaults to
    `%ES_HOME%\config`.

`ES_JAVA_OPTS`::

    Any additional JVM system properties you may want to apply.

`ES_START_TYPE`::

    Startup mode for the service. Can be either `auto` or `manual` (default).

`ES_STOP_TIMEOUT`::

  The timeout in seconds that procrun waits for service to exit gracefully. Defaults to `0`.

NOTE: At its core, `elasticsearch-service.bat` relies on https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/[Apache Commons Daemon] project
to install the service. Environment variables set prior to the service installation are copied and will be used during the service lifecycle. This means any changes made to them after the installation will not be picked up unless the service is reinstalled.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {es} automatically sizes JVM heap based on a node's
<<node-roles,roles>> and total memory. We recommend this default sizing for most
production environments. If needed, you can override default sizing by manually
setting the heap size.

When installing {es} on Windows as a service for the first time or running {es}
from the command line, you can manually <<set-jvm-heap-size>>.
To resize the heap for an already installed service,
use the service manager: `bin\elasticsearch-service.bat manager`.
====

NOTE: The service automatically configures a private temporary directory for use
by {es} when it is running. This private temporary directory is
configured as a sub-directory of the private temporary directory for the user
running the installation. If the service will run under a different user, you
can configure the location of the temporary directory that the service should
use by setting the environment variable `ES_TMPDIR` to the preferred location
before you execute the service installation.

Using the Manager GUI::

It is also possible to configure the service after it's been installed using the manager GUI (`elasticsearch-service-mgr.exe`), which offers insight into the installed service, including its status, startup type, JVM, start and stop settings amongst other things. Invoke `elasticsearch-service.bat manager` from the command-line to open the manager window.

Most changes (like JVM settings) made through the manager GUI will require a restart of the service to take affect.

[[windows-layout]]
==== Directory layout of `.zip` archive

The `.zip` package is entirely self-contained. All files and directories are,
by default, contained within `%ES_HOME%` -- the directory created when
unpacking the archive.

This is very convenient because you don't have to create any directories to
start using {es}, and uninstalling {es} is as easy as
removing the `%ES_HOME%` directory. However, it is advisable to change the
default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs
directory so that you do not delete important data later on.

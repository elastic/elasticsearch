=== JNA temporary directory not mounted with `noexec`

[NOTE]
This is only relevant for Linux.

Elasticsearch uses the Java Native Access (JNA) library for executing some
platform-dependent native code. On Linux, the native code backing this library
is extracted at runtime from the JNA archive. This code is extracted
to the Elasticsearch temporary directory which defaults to a sub-directory of
`/tmp` and can be configured with the <<es-tmpdir,ES_TMPDIR>> variable.
Alternatively, this location can be controlled with the JVM flag
`-Djna.tmpdir=<path>`. As the native library is mapped into the JVM virtual
address space as executable, the underlying mount point of the location that
this code is extracted to must *not* be mounted with `noexec` as this prevents
the JVM process from being able to map this code as executable. On some hardened
Linux installations this is a default mount option for `/tmp`. One indication
that the underlying mount is mounted with `noexec` is that at startup JNA will
fail to load with a `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkerError` exception with a message
along the lines of `failed to map segment from shared object`. Note that the
exception message can differ amongst JVM versions. Additionally, the components
of Elasticsearch that rely on execution of native code via JNA will fail with
messages indicating that it is `because JNA is not available`. If you are seeing
such error messages, you must remount the temporary directory used for JNA to
not be mounted with `noexec`.

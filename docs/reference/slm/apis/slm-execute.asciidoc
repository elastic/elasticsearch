POST /_slm/policy/daily-snapshots/_execute
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:we can't easily handle snapshots from docs tests]

If successful, this request returns the generated snapshot name:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "snapshot_name": "daily-snap-2019.04.24-gwrqoo2xtea3q57vvg0uea"

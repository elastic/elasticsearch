[[slm-api-put-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`config`::
(Required, object)
Configuration for each snapshot created by the policy.
+
.Properties of `config`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`ignore_unavailable`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, missing data streams or indices do *not* cause snapshot creation to fail and return
an error. Defaults to `false`.

`include_global_state`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, cluster states are included in snapshots. Defaults to `false`.

`indices`::
(Optional, array of strings)
Array of data streams and indices to include in snapshots.
<<date-math-index-names,Date math>> and wildcard (`*`) expressions are
supported.
====

`name`::
(Required, string)
Name automatically assigned to each snapshot created by the policy.
<<date-math-index-names,Date math>> is supported.
To prevent conflicting snapshot names, a UUID is automatically appended to each 
snapshot name.

`repository`::
(Required, string)
Repository used to store snapshots created by this policy. This repository must 
exist prior to the policy's creation. You can create a repository using the 
<<modules-snapshots,snapshot repository API>>.

[[slm-api-put-retention]]
`retention`::
(Optional, object)
Retention rules used to retain and delete snapshots created by the policy.
+
.Properties of `retention`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`expire_after`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>)
Time period after which a snapshot is considered expired and eligible for
deletion.

`max_count`::
(Optional, integer)
Maximum number of snapshots to retain, even if the snapshots have not yet
expired. If the number of snapshots in the repository exceeds this limit, the 
policy retains the most recent snapshots and deletes older snapshots.

`min_count`::
(Optional, integer)
Minimum number of snapshots to retain, even if the snapshots have expired.
====

`schedule`::
(Required, <<cron-expressions,Cron syntax>>)
Periodic or absolute schedule at which the policy creates snapshots and deletes

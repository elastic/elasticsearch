Turn off {slm} ({slm-init}).

[[slm-api-stop-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`POST /_slm/stop`

[[slm-api-stop-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage_slm`
cluster privilege to use this API. For more information, see
<<security-privileges>>.

[[slm-api-stop-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Halts all {slm} ({slm-init}) operations and stops the {slm-init} plugin.
This is useful when you are performing maintenance on a cluster and need to
prevent {slm-init} from performing any actions on your data streams or indices. 
Stopping {slm-init} does not stop any snapshots that are in progress.
You can manually trigger snapshots with the <<slm-api-execute-lifecycle>> even if {slm-init} is stopped.

The API returns a response as soon as the request is acknowledged, but 
the plugin might continue to run until in-progress operations complete and it can be safely stopped. 

Use the  <<slm-api-get-status>> to see if {slm-init} is running.

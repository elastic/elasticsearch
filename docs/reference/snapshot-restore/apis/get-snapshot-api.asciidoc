[[get-snapshot-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>`

[[get-snapshot-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Use the get snapshot API to return information about one or more snapshots, including:

* Start and end time values
* Version of {es} that created the snapshot
* List of included indices
* Current state of the snapshot
* List of failures that occurred during the snapshot

[[get-snapshot-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<repository>`::
(Required, string)
Snapshot repository name used to limit the request.

`<snapshot>`::
(Required, string)
Comma-separated list of snapshot names to retrieve. Also accepts wildcards (`*`).
+
* To get information about all snapshots in a registered repository, use a wildcard (`*`) or `_all`.
* To get information about any snapshots that are currently running, use `_current`.
+
NOTE: Using `_all` in a request fails if any snapshots are unavailable.
Set <<get-snapshot-api-ignore-unavailable,`ignore_unavailable`>> to `true` to return only available snapshots.

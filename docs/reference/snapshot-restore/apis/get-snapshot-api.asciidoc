[[get-snapshot-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>`

[[get-snapshot-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the
`monitor_snapshot`, `create_snapshot`, or `manage`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

[[get-snapshot-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Use the get snapshot API to return information about one or more snapshots, including:

* Start and end time values
* Version of {es} that created the snapshot
* List of included indices
* Current state of the snapshot
* List of failures that occurred during the snapshot

[[get-snapshot-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<repository>`::
(Required, string)
Snapshot repository name used to limit the request.

`<snapshot>`::
(Required, string)
Comma-separated list of snapshot names to retrieve. Also accepts wildcards (`*`).
+
* To get information about all snapshots in a registered repository, use a wildcard (`*`) or `_all`.
* To get information about any snapshots that are currently running, use `_current`.
+
NOTE: Using `_all` in a request fails if any snapshots are unavailable.
Set <<get-snapshot-api-ignore-unavailable,`ignore_unavailable`>> to `true` to return only available snapshots.

[[get-snapshot-api-ignore-unavailable]]
`ignore_unavailable`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `false`, the request returns an error for any snapshots that are unavailable. Defaults to `false`.
+
If `true`, the request ignores snapshots that are unavailable, such as those that are corrupted or temporarily cannot be returned.

`verbose`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, returns additional information about each snapshot such as the
version of Elasticsearch which took the snapshot, the start and end times of
the snapshot, and the number of shards snapshotted. Defaults to `true`. If
`false`, omits the additional information.

`index_details`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, returns additional information about each index in the snapshot
comprising the number of shards in the index, the total size of the index in
bytes, and the maximum number of segments per shard in the index. Defaults to
`false`, meaning that this information is omitted.

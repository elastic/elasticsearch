[[get-snapshot-status-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET _snapshot/_status`

`GET _snapshot/<repository>/_status`

`GET _snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>/_status`

[[get-snapshot-status-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the
`monitor_snapshot`, `create_snapshot`, or `manage`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

[[get-snapshot-status-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

Use the get snapshot status API to get detailed information about the shards
participating in a snapshot.

If you omit the `<snapshot>` request path parameter, the request only retrieves
information for currently running snapshots. This usage is preferred.

If needed, you can specify `<repository>` and `<snapshot>` to retrieve
information for specific snapshots, even if they're not currently running.

[WARNING]
====
Using the API to return the status of any snapshots other than currently running
snapshots can be expensive. The API requires a read from the repository for each
shard in each snapshot. For example, if you have 100 snapshots with 1,000 shards
each, an API request that includes all snapshots will require 100,000 reads (100
snapshots * 1,000 shards).

Depending on the latency of your storage, such requests can take an extremely
long time to return results. These requests can also tax machine resources
and, when using cloud storage, incur high processing costs.
====

[[get-snapshot-status-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<repository>`::
(Optional, string)
Snapshot repository name used to limit the request. Supports wildcards (`*`) if
`<snapshot>` isn't specified.

`<snapshot>`::
(Optional, string)
Comma-separated list of snapshots to retrieve status for. Defaults to
currently running snapshots. Wildcards (`*`) are not supported.

`ignore_unavailable`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `false`, the request returns an error for any snapshots that are unavailable. Defaults to `false`.
+
If `true`, the request ignores snapshots that are unavailable, such as those that are corrupted or temporarily cannot be returned.

Registers or updates a <<snapshots-register-repository,snapshot repository>>.

[source,console]
----
PUT /_snapshot/my_repository
{
  "type": "fs",
  "settings": {
    "location": "my_backup_location"
  }

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`PUT /_snapshot/<repository>`

`POST /_snapshot/<repository>`

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

A snapshot repository must be registered before you can perform
<<snapshot-restore,snapshot and restore>> operations. You can use the put
snapshot repository API to register new repositories and update existing ones.
See <<snapshots-register-repository>>.

TIP: Because snapshot formats can change between major versions of
{es}, we recommend registering a new snapshot repository for each major version.
See <<snapshot-restore-version-compatibility>>.

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<repository>`::
(Required, string)
Name of the snapshot repository to register or update.

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

IMPORTANT: Several options for this API can be specified using a query parameter
or a request body parameter. If both parameters are specified, only the query
parameter is used.

`master_timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>) Specifies the period of time to wait for
a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout
expires, the request fails and returns an error. Defaults to `30s`.

`timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>) Specifies the period of time to wait for
a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request
fails and returns an error. Defaults to `30s`.

`verify`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, the request verifies the repository is functional on all master and
data nodes in the cluster. If `false`, this verification is skipped. Defaults to
`true`.
+
You can manually perform this verification using the
<<verify-snapshot-repo-api,verify snapshot repository API>>.

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`master_timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>)
Specifies the period of time to wait for
a connection to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout
expires, the request fails and returns an error. Defaults to `30s`.

`timeout`::
(Optional, <<time-units, time units>>)
Specifies the period of time to wait for
a response. If no response is received before the timeout expires, the request
fails and returns an error. Defaults to `30s`.

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-request-type]]
`type`::
+
--
(Required, string)
Repository type.

.Valid values for `type`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`fs`::
Shared file system repository. Repositories of this type use a shared file
system to store snapshots. This file system must accessible to all master and
data nodes in the cluster.
+
IMPORTANT: To register a shared file system repository, you must mount the same
shared filesystem to the same location on all master and data nodes. This
location must be registered in the `path.repo` setting on all master and data
nodes in the cluster.
+
See <<snapshots-filesystem-repository>>.

[xpack]#`source`#::
Source-only repository. You can use source-only repositories to create minimal,
source-only snapshots that take up to 50% less space on disk.
+
Source-only snapshots are only supported if the <<mapping-source-field,`_source`
field>> is enabled and no
<<source-filtering,source-filtering>> is applied.
+
WARNING: Source-only snapshots contain stored fields and index metadata. They do
not include index or doc values structures and are not searchable when restored.
After restoring a source-only snapshot, you must <<docs-reindex,reindex>> the
data into a new index.
+
See <<snapshots-source-only-repository>>.

`url`::
URL repository. Repositories of this type are read-only
for the cluster. This means the cluster can retrieve or restore snapshots from
the repository but cannot write or create snapshots in it.
+
You can use URL repositories as an alternative way to give a cluster read-only
access to a shared file system (`fs`) repository.
+
See <<snapshots-read-only-repository>>.

[[put-snapshot-repo-api-settings-param]]
`settings`::
+
--
(Required, object)
Contains settings for the repository. Valid properties for the `settings` object
depend on the repository type, set using the
<<put-snapshot-repo-api-request-type,`type`>> parameter.

[%collapsible%open]
====
`chunk_size`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum size of files in snapshots. In snapshots, files larger than this are
broken down into chunks of this size or smaller. Defaults to `null` (unlimited
file size).

`compress`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, metadata files, such as index mappings and settings, are compressed
in snapshots. Data files are not compressed. Defaults to `true`.

`location`::
(Required, string)
Location of the shared filesystem used to store and retrieve snapshots. This
location must be registered in the `path.repo` setting on all master and data
nodes in the cluster.

`max_restore_bytes_per_sec`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum snapshot restore rate per node. Defaults to unlimited. Note
that restores are also throttled through <<recovery,recovery settings>>.

`max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum snapshot creation rate per node. Defaults to `40mb` per second.

`readonly`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, the repository is read-only. The cluster can retrieve and restore
snapshots from the repository but not write to the repository or create
snapshots in it.
+
If `false`, the cluster can write to the repository and create snapshots in it.
Defaults to `false`.
+
[TIP]
=====
If you register the same snapshot repository with multiple clusters, only
one cluster should have write access to the repository. Having multiple clusters
write to the repository at the same time risks corrupting the contents of the
repository.

Only a cluster with write access can create snapshots in the repository. All
other clusters connected to the repository should have the `readonly` parameter
set to `true`. This means those clusters can retrieve or restore snapshots from
the repository but not create snapshots in it.

`delegate_type`::
(Optional, string)
Delegated repository type. For valid values, see the
<<put-snapshot-repo-api-request-type,`type` parameter>>.
+
`source` repositories can use `settings` properties for its delegated repository
type. See <<snapshots-source-only-repository>>.

.Valid `settings` properties for `url` repositories
[%collapsible%open]
====
`url`::
(Required, string)
URL location of the root of the shared filesystem repository. The following
protocols are supported:

* `file`
* `ftp`
* `http`
* `https`
* `jar`

URLs using the `file` protocol must point to the location of a shared filesystem
accessible to all master and data nodes in the cluster. This location must be
registered in the `path.repo` setting.

URLs using the `http`, `https`, or `ftp` protocols must be explicitly allowed with the
`repositories.url.allowed_urls` setting. This setting supports wildcards in the
place of a host, path, query, or fragment in the URL.

`verify`::
(Optional, boolean)
If `true`, the request verifies the repository is functional on all master and
data nodes in the cluster. If `false`, this verification is skipped. Defaults to
`true`.

You can manually perform this verification using the
<<snapshots-repository-verification,verify snapshot repository API>>.

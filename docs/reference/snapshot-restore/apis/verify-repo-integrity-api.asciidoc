[[verify-repo-integrity-api-request]]

`POST /_snapshot/<repository>/_verify_integrity`

[[verify-repo-integrity-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API. For more
information, see <<security-privileges>>.

[[verify-repo-integrity-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

This API allows you to perform a comprehensive check of the contents of a
repository, looking for any anomalies in its data or metadata which might
prevent you from restoring snapshots from the repository or which might cause
future snapshot create or delete operations to fail.

If you suspect the integrity of the contents of one of your snapshot
repositories, cease all write activity to this repository immediately, set its
`read_only` option to `true`, and use this API to verify its integrity. Until
you do so:

* It may not be possible to <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,restore some
  snapshots>> from this repository.

* <<searchable-snapshots>> may report errors when searched, or may have
  unassigned shards.

* <<snapshots-take-snapshot,Taking snapshots>> into this repository may fail,
  or may appear to succeed having created a snapshot which cannot be restored.

* <<delete-snapshot-api,Deleting snapshots>> from this repository may fail, or
  may appear to succeed leaving the underlying data on disk.

* Continuing to write to the repository while it is in an invalid state may
  causing additional damage to its contents.

If the <<verify-repo-integrity-api>> API finds any problems with the integrity
of the contents of your repository, {es} will not be able to repair the damage.
The only way to bring the repository back into a fully working state after its
contents have been damaged is by restoring its contents from a
<<snapshots-repository-backup,repository backup>> which was taken before the
damage occurred. You must also identify what caused the damage and take action
to prevent it from happening again.

If you cannot restore a repository backup,
<<snapshots-register-repository,register a new repository>> and use this for
all future snapshot operations. In some cases it may be possible to recover
some of the contents of a damaged repository, either by
<<snapshots-restore-snapshot,restoring>> as many of its snapshots as needed and
<<snapshots-take-snapshot,taking new snapshots>> of the restored data, or by
using the <<docs-reindex>> API to copy data from any <<searchable-snapshots>>
mounted from the damaged repository.

Avoid all operations which write to the repository while the
<<verify-repo-integrity-api>> API is running. If something changes the
repository contents while an integrity verification is running then {es} may
incorrectly report having detected some anomalies in its contents due to the
concurrent writes. It may also incorrectly fail to report some anomalies that
the concurrent writes prevented it from detecting.

NOTE: This API is intended for exploratory use by humans. You should expect the
request parameters and the response format to vary in future versions.

NOTE: This API may not work correctly in a mixed-version cluster.

[[verify-repo-integrity-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<repository>`::
(Required, string)
Name of the snapshot repository whose integrity to verify.

[[verify-repo-integrity-api-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

The default values for the parameters of this API are designed to limit the
impact of the integrity verification on other activities in your cluster. For
instance, by default it will only use at most half of the `snapshot_meta`
threads to verify the integrity of each snapshot, allowing other snapshot
operations to use the other half of this thread pool.

If you modify these parameters to speed up the verification process, you risk
disrupting other snapshot-related operations in your cluster. For large
repositories, consider setting up a separate single-node {es} cluster just for
running the integrity verification API.

`snapshot_verification_concurrency`::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the number of snapshots to verify concurrently.
Defaults to `0` which means to use at most half of the `snapshot_meta` thread
pool at once.

`index_verification_concurrency`::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the number of indices to verify concurrently.
Defaults to `0` which means to use the entire `snapshot_meta` thread pool.

`meta_thread_pool_concurrency`::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum number of snapshot metadata
operations to execute concurrently. Defaults to `0` which means to use at most
half of the `snapshot_meta` thread pool at once.

`index_snapshot_verification_concurrency`::
(Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum number of index snapshots to verify
concurrently within each index verification. Defaults to `1`.

`max_failed_shard_snapshots`::
(Optional, integer) Limits the number of shard snapshot failures to track
during integrity verification, in order to avoid excessive resource usage. If
your repository contains more than this number of shard snapshot failures then
the verification will fail. Defaults to `10000`.

`verify_blob_contents`::
(Optional, boolean) Specifies whether to verify the checksum of every data blob
in the repository. Defaults to `false`. If this feature is enabled, {es} will
read the entire repository contents, which may be extremely slow and expensive.

`blob_thread_pool_concurrency`::
(Optional, integer) If `?verify_blob_contents` is `true`, this parameter
specifies how many blobs to verify at once. Defaults to `1`.

`max_bytes_per_sec`::
(Optional, <<size-units, size units>>)
If `?verify_blob_contents` is `true`, this parameter specifies the maximum
amount of data that {es} will read from the repository every second. Defaults
to `10mb`.

[[verify-repo-integrity-api-response-body]]
==== {api-response-body-title}

The response exposes implementation details of the analysis which may change
from version to version. The response body format is therefore not considered
stable and may be different in newer versions.

`log`::
(array) A sequence of objects that report the progress of the analysis.

.Properties of `log`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`timestamp_in_millis`::
(integer) The timestamp of this log entry, represented as the number of
milliseconds since the {wikipedia}/Unix_time[Unix epoch].

`timestamp`::
(string) The timestamp of this log entry, represented as a string formatted
according to {wikipedia}/ISO_8601[ISO 8601]. Only included if the
<<common-options,`?human`>> flag is set.

`snapshot`::
(object) If the log entry pertains to a particular snapshot then the snapshot
will be described in this object.

`index`::
(object) If the log entry pertains to a particular index then the index will be
described in this object.

`snapshot_restorability`::
(object) If the log entry pertains to the restorability of an index then the
details will be described in this object.

`anomaly`::
(string) If the log entry pertains to an anomaly in the repository contents then
this string will describe the anomaly.

`exception`::
(object) If the log entry pertains to an exception that {es} encountered during
the verification then the details will be included in this object.

====

`results`::
(object) An object which describes the final results of the analysis.
+
.Properties of `results`
[%collapsible%open]
====
`status`::
(object) The final status of the analysis task.

`final_repository_generation`::
(integer) The repository generation at the end of the analysis. If there were
any writes to the repository during the analysis then this value will be
different from the `generation` reported in the task status, and the analysis
may have detected spurious anomalies due to the concurrent writes, or may even
have failed to detect some anomalies in the repository contents.

`total_anomalies`::
(integer) The total number of anomalies detected during the analysis.

`result`::
(string) The final result of the analysis. If the repository contents appear to
be intact then this will be the string `pass`. If this field is missing, or
contains some other value, then the repository contents were not fully
verified.

====

`exception`::
(object) If the analysis encountered an exception which prevented it from
completing successfully then this exception will be reported here.

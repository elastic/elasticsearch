=== Shared file system repository

include::{es-repo-dir}/snapshot-restore/on-prem-repo-type.asciidoc[]

Use a shared file system repository to store snapshots on a shared file system.

To register a shared file system repository, first mount the file system to the
same location on all master and data nodes. Then add the file system's path or
parent directory to the `path.repo` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` for each
master and data node. For running clusters, this requires a
<<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>> of each node.

Supported `path.repo` values vary by platform:

==== Repository settings

`chunk_size`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum size of files in snapshots. In snapshots, files larger than this are
broken down into chunks of this size or smaller. Defaults to `null` (unlimited
file size).

`compress`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, metadata files, such as index mappings and settings, are compressed
in snapshots. Data files are not compressed. Defaults to `true`.

`location`::
(Required, string)
Location of the shared filesystem used to store and retrieve snapshots. This
location must be registered in the `path.repo` setting on all master and data
nodes in the cluster.

`max_number_of_snapshots`::
(Optional, integer)
Maximum number of snapshots the repository can contain.
Defaults to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which is `2^31-1` or `2147483647`.

==== Troubleshooting a shared file system repository

{es} interacts with a shared file system repository using the file system
abstraction in your OS. This means that every {es} node must be able to perform
operations within the repository such as creating and opening files, and
creating and listing directories, and operations performed by one node must be
visible to other nodes as soon as they complete.

Check for common misconfigurations using the <<verify-snapshot-repo-api>> API
and the <<repo-analysis-api>> API. When the repository is properly configured,
these APIs will complete successfully. If the verify repository or repository
analysis APIs report a problem then you will be able to reproduce this problem
outside {es} by performing similar operations on the file system directly.

If the verify repository or repository analysis APIs fail with an error
indicating insufficient permissions then adjust the configuration of your
repository within the OS to give {es} an appropriate level of access. To
reproduce such problems directly, perform the same operations as {es} in the
same security context as the one in which {es} is running. For example, on
Linux, use a command such as `su` to switch to the user as which {es} runs.

If the verify repository or repository analysis APIs fail with an error
indicating that operations on one node are not immediately visible on another
node then adjust the configuration of your repository within the OS to address
this problem. If your repository cannot be configured with strong enough
visibility guarantees then it is not compatible with {es}.

The verify repository and repository analysis APIs will also fail if the OS
returns any other kind of I/O error when accessing the repository. If this
happens, address the cause of the I/O error reported by the OS.

TIP: By default a network file system (NFS) uses numeric user IDs (UIDs) and
group IDs (GIDs) to match accounts across nodes. If your shared file system
uses NFS then ensure that every node is running with the same numeric UID and
GID, or else update your NFS configuration to account for the variance across
nodes.

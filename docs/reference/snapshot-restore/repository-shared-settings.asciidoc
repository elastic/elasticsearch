`max_restore_bytes_per_sec`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum snapshot restore rate per node. Defaults to unlimited. Note
that restores are also throttled through <<recovery,recovery settings>>.

`max_snapshot_bytes_per_sec`::
(Optional, <<byte-units,byte value>>)
Maximum snapshot creation rate per node. Defaults to `40mb` per second.
Note that if the <<recovery-settings-for-managed-services,recovery settings for managed services>>

throttled through <<recovery,recovery settings>>.

//tag::readonly-repo-setting[]
`readonly`::
(Optional, Boolean)
If `true`, the repository is read-only. The cluster can retrieve and restore
snapshots from the repository but not write to the repository or create
snapshots in it.
+
Only a cluster with write access can create snapshots in the repository. All
other clusters connected to the repository should have the `readonly` parameter
set to `true`.
+
If `false`, the cluster can write to the repository and create snapshots in it.
Defaults to `false`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
If you register the same snapshot repository with multiple clusters, only
one cluster should have write access to the repository. Having multiple clusters
write to the repository at the same time risks corrupting the contents of the
repository.

== Restore a snapshot

PUT /_snapshot/my_backup

Use the <<restore-snapshot-api,restore snapshot API>> to restore
a snapshot of a cluster or specified data streams and indices:

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
POST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
-----------------------------------

By default, all data streams and indices in the snapshot are restored, but the cluster state is
*not* restored. It's possible to select specific data streams or indices that should be restored as well
as to allow the global cluster state from being restored by using `indices` and
`include_global_state` options in the restore request body. The list
supports <<multi-index,multi-target syntax>>.

[WARNING]
====
Each data stream requires a matching
<<create-a-data-stream-template,index template>>. The stream uses this
template to create new backing indices.

When restoring a data stream, ensure a matching template exists for the stream.
You can do this using one of the following methods:

* Check for existing templates that match the stream. If no matching template
  exists, <<create-a-data-stream-template,create one>>.

* Restore a global cluster state that includes a matching template for the
  stream.

If no index template matches a data stream, the stream cannot
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,roll over>> or create new backing indices.
====

The `rename_pattern`
and `rename_replacement` options can be also used to rename data streams and indices on restore
using regular expression that supports referencing the original text as
explained
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#appendReplacement(java.lang.StringBuffer,%20java.lang.String)[here].

[[rename-restored-data-stream]]
// tag::rename-restored-data-stream-tag[]
If you rename a restored data stream, its backing indices are also
renamed. For example, if you rename the `logs` data stream to `restored-logs`,
the backing index `.ds-logs-000005` is renamed to `.ds-restored-logs-000005`.

[WARNING]
====
If you rename a restored stream, ensure an index template matches the new stream
name. If no index template matches the stream, it cannot
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,roll over>> or create new backing indices.
====
// end::rename-restored-data-stream-tag[]

Set `include_aliases` to `false` to prevent aliases from being restored together
with associated indices.

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
POST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
{
  "indices": "data_stream_1,index_1,index_2",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false,              <1>
  "rename_pattern": "index_(.+)",
  "rename_replacement": "restored_index_$1",
  "include_aliases": false
}
-----------------------------------
// TEST[continued]

<1> By default, `include_global_state` is `false`, meaning the snapshot's
cluster state is not restored.
+
If `true`, the snapshot's persistent settings, index templates, ingest
pipelines, and {ilm-init} policies are restored into the current cluster. This
overwrites any existing cluster settings, templates, pipelines and {ilm-init}
policies whose names match those in the snapshot.

The restore operation can be performed on a functioning cluster. However, an
existing index can be only restored if it's <<indices-close,closed>> and
has the same number of shards as the index in the snapshot. The restore
operation automatically opens restored indices if they were closed and creates
new indices if they didn't exist in the cluster.

If a data stream is restored, its backing indices are also restored. The restore
operation automatically opens restored backing indices if they were closed.

NOTE: You cannot restore a data stream if a stream with the same name already
exists.

In addition to entire data streams, you can restore only specific backing
indices from a snapshot. However, restored backing indices are not automatically
added to any existing data streams. For example, if only the `.ds-logs-000003`
backing index is restored from a snapshot, it is not automatically added to the
existing `logs` data stream.

[float]
=== Partial restore

By default, the entire restore operation will fail if one or more indices or backing indices participating in the operation don't have
snapshots of all shards available. It can occur if some shards failed to snapshot for example. It is still possible to
restore such indices by setting `partial` to `true`. Please note, that only successfully snapshotted shards will be
restored in this case and all missing shards will be recreated empty.


[float]
=== Changing index settings during restore

Most of index settings can be overridden during the restore process. For example, the following command will restore
the index `index_1` without creating any replicas while switching back to default refresh interval:

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
POST /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
{
  "indices": "index_1",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "index_settings": {
    "index.number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "ignore_index_settings": [
    "index.refresh_interval"
  ]
}
-----------------------------------
// TEST[continued]

Please note, that some settings such as `index.number_of_shards` cannot be changed during restore operation.

For data streams, these index settings are applied to the restored backing
indices.

// tag::index-settings-data-stream-warning[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `index_settings` and `ignore_index_settings` parameters affect
restored backing indices only. New backing indices created for a stream use the index
settings specified in the stream's matching
<<create-a-data-stream-template,index template>>.

If you change index settings during a restore, we recommend you make similar
changes in the stream's matching index template. This ensures new backing
indices created for the stream use the same index settings.

=== Restoring to a different cluster

The information stored in a snapshot is not tied to a particular cluster or a cluster name. Therefore it's possible to
restore a snapshot made from one cluster into another cluster. All that is required is registering the repository
containing the snapshot in the new cluster and starting the restore process. The new cluster doesn't have to have the
same size or topology.  However, the version of the new cluster should be the same or newer (only 1 major version newer) than the cluster that was used to create the snapshot.  For example, you can restore a 1.x snapshot to a 2.x cluster, but not a 1.x snapshot to a 5.x cluster.

If the new cluster has a smaller size additional considerations should be made. First of all it's necessary to make sure
that new cluster have enough capacity to store all data streams and indices in the snapshot. It's possible to change index settings
during restore to reduce the number of replicas, which can help with restoring snapshots into smaller cluster. It's also
possible to select only subset of the data streams or indices using the `indices` parameter.

If indices or backing indices in the original cluster were assigned to particular nodes using
<<shard-allocation-filtering,shard allocation filtering>>, the same rules will be enforced in the new cluster. Therefore
if the new cluster doesn't contain nodes with appropriate attributes that a restored index can be allocated on, such
index will not be successfully restored unless these index allocation settings are changed during restore operation.

The restore operation also checks that restored persistent settings are compatible with the current cluster to avoid accidentally
restoring incompatible settings. If you need to restore a snapshot with incompatible persistent settings, try restoring it without
the global cluster state.

== Restore a snapshot

This guide shows you how to restore a snapshot. Snapshots are a convenient way
to transfer data between clusters. You can also restore a snapshot to recover
indices after deletion or a hardware failure.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

* Retrieve available snapshots
* Restore an index or data stream from a snapshot
* Monitor the restore operation
* Cancel an ongoing restore

The guide also provides tips for <<restore-different-cluster,restoring to
another cluster>>.

[[retrieve-snapshot]]
=== Retrieve a snapshot

To view a list of available snapshots in {kib}, go to the main menu and click
*Stack Management > Snapshot and Restore*.

You can also use the <<get-snapshot-repo-api,get repository API>> to fetch a
list of registered snapshot repositories.

[source,console]
----
GET _snapshot
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]

Use the <<get-snapshot-api,get snapshot API>> to retrieve snapshots for a
repository.

[source,console]
----
GET _snapshot/my_repository/*?verbose=false
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]

[[restore-index-data-stream]]
=== Restore an index or data stream

You can restore an index or data stream from a snapshot using {kib}'s *Snapshot
and Restore* feature or the <<restore-snapshot-api,restore snapshot API>>.

You can only restore an existing index if it's closed. You can't restore an
existing data stream. Use one of the following methods to avoid conflicts with
existing indices or data streams:

* <<delete-restore>>
* <<close-restore>>
* <<rename-on-restore>>

[discrete]
[[delete-restore]]
==== Delete and restore

The simplest way to avoid conflicts is to delete an existing index or data
stream before restoring it. To prevent the accidental recreation of the index or
data stream, we recommend you temporarily stop all indexing until the restore
operation is complete.

// Only display warning in 7.x.
// In 7.x, `action.destructive_requires_name` defaults to false.
ifeval::[ "{major-version}" == "7.x" ]
WARNING: Don't use the <<indices-delete-index,delete index API>> to target the
`*` or `.*` wildcard expressions. If you use {es}'s security features, this will
delete system indices required for authentication. To delete all regular
indices, use `*,-.*`.
endif::[]

[source,console]
----
# Delete an index
DELETE my-index

# Delete a data stream
DELETE _data_stream/logs-my_app-default

# Restore the index and data stream from a snapshot
POST _snapshot/my_repository/my_snapshot/_restore 
{
  "indices": "my-index,logs-my_app-default"
}
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]
// TEST[s/_restore/_restore?wait_for_completion=true/]

[discrete]
[[close-restore]]
==== Close and restore

You can restore an existing index if it's closed. However, the index in the
snapshot must have the same number of primary shards. You can't close a data
stream.

// Only display warning in 7.x.
// In 7.x, `action.destructive_requires_name` defaults to false.
ifeval::["{major-version}" == "7.x"]
WARNING: Don't use the <<indices-close,close index API>> to target the `*` or
`.*` wildcard expressions. If you use {es}'s security features, this will close
system indices required for authentication. To close all regular indices, use
`*,-.*`.
endif::[]

[source,console]
----
# Close an index
POST my-index/_close

# Restore the index from a snapshot
POST _snapshot/my_repository/my_snapshot/_restore 
{
  "indices": "my-index"
}
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]
// TEST[s/_restore/_restore?wait_for_completion=true/]

[discrete]
[[rename-on-restore]]
==== Rename on restore

You can rename indices and data streams you restore. Before you start, ensure
the cluster has enough capacity to store both the existing and restored data.

The following restore snapshot API request prepends `restored-` to the name of
any restored index or data stream.

[source,console]
----
POST _snapshot/my_repository/my_snapshot/_restore 
{
  "indices": "my-index,logs-my_app-default",
  "rename_pattern": "(.+)",
  "rename_replacement": "restored-$1"
}
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]
// TEST[s/_restore/_restore?wait_for_completion=true/]

When the restore operation is complete, you can delete the original indices and
data streams. You can then use a <<docs-reindex,reindex>> to rename the restored
indices and data streams.

[source,console]
----
# Delete the original index
DELETE my-index

# Reindex the restored index to rename it
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "restored-my-index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "my-index"
  }
}

# Delete the original data stream
DELETE _data_stream/logs-my_app-default

# Reindex the restored data stream to rename it
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "restored-logs-my_app-default"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "logs-my_app-default",
    "op_type": "create"
  }
}
----
// TEST[continued]

[discrete]
[[monitor-restore]]
=== Monitor a restore

The restore operation uses the <<indices-recovery,recovery process>> to restore
an index's primary shards from a snapshot. While the restore operation
recovers primary shards, the cluster will have a `yellow`
<<cluster-health,health status>>.

After all primary shards are recovered, the replication process creates and
distributes replicas across eligible data nodes. When replication is complete,
the cluster health status typically becomes `green`.

You can monitor the cluster health status using the <<cluster-health,cluster
health API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET _cluster/health
----

To get detailed information about ongoing shard recoveries, use the
<<indices-recovery,index recovery API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET my-index/_recovery
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]

To view any unassigned shards, use the <<cat-shards,cat shards API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET _cat/shards?v=true&h=index,shard,prirep,state,node,unassigned.reason&s=state
----

Unassigned shards have a `state` of `UNASSIGNED`. The `prirep` value is `p` for
primary shards and `r` for replicas. The `unassigned.reason` describes why the
shard remains unassigned.

To get a more in-depth explanation of an unassigned shard's allocation status,
use the <<cluster-allocation-explain,cluster allocation explanation API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET _cluster/allocation/explain?filter_path=index,node_allocation_decisions.node_name,node_allocation_decisions.deciders.*
{
  "index": "my-index",
  "shard": 0,
  "primary": false,
  "current_node": "my-node"
}
----
// TEST[s/^/PUT my-index\n/]
// TEST[s/"primary": false,/"primary": false/]
// TEST[s/"current_node": "my-node"//]

[discrete]
[[cancel-restore]]
=== Cancel a restore

You can delete an index or data stream to cancel its ongoing restore.

[source,console]
----
# Delete an index
DELETE my-index

# Delete a data stream
DELETE _data_stream/logs-my_app-default
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]

[discrete]
[[restore-different-cluster]]
=== Restore to a different cluster

The information stored in a snapshot is not tied to a particular cluster or a cluster name. Therefore, it's possible to
restore a snapshot created from one cluster into another cluster by registering the repository that contains the snapshot in the new cluster and starting the restore process.

The topology of the new cluster does not have to match the cluster where the snapshot was created. However, the version of the new cluster must be the same or only one major version newer than the cluster that was used to create the snapshot. For example, you can restore a 5.x snapshot to a 6.x cluster, but not a 5.x snapshot to a 7.x cluster.

If the new cluster has a smaller capacity, consider the following changes:

* Ensure that the new cluster has enough capacity to store all data streams and indices in the snapshot.
* Restore fewer indices and data streams from the snapshot.
* Change the index settings during the restore operation to reduce the
<<dynamic-index-number-of-replicas,number of replicas>>.
+
For example, the following restore snapshot API request uses the
`index_settings` option to set `index.number_of_replicas` to `1`.
+
[source,console]
----
POST _snapshot/my_repository/my_snapshot/_restore
{
  "indices": "my-index,logs-my_app-default",
  "index_settings": {
    "index.number_of_replicas": 1
  }
}
----
// TEST[setup:setup-snapshots]
// TEST[s/^/DELETE my-index\nDELETE _data_stream\/logs-my_app-default\n/]
// TEST[s/_restore/_restore?wait_for_completion=true/]

If indices or backing indices in the original cluster were assigned to particular nodes using
<<shard-allocation-filtering,shard allocation filtering>>, the same rules will be enforced in the new cluster. If the new cluster does not contain nodes with appropriate attributes that a restored index can be allocated on, the
index will not be successfully restored unless these index allocation settings are changed during the restore operation.

The restore operation also checks that restored persistent settings are compatible with the current cluster to avoid accidentally
restoring incompatible settings. If you need to restore a snapshot with incompatible persistent settings, try restoring it without
the <<restore-snapshot-api-include-global-state,global cluster state>>.

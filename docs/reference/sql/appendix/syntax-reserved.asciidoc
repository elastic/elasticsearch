== Reserved keywords

Table with reserved keywords that need to be quoted. Also provide an example to make it more obvious.

The following table lists all of the keywords that are reserved in {es-sql},
along with their status in the SQL standard. These reserved keywords must
be quoted (using double quotes) in order to be used as an identifier, for example:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT "AS" FROM index
----

[cols="^,^,^"]

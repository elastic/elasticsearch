=== DbVisualizer

You can use the {es} JDBC driver to access {es} data from DbVisualizer.

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application.

==== Prerequisites

* https://www.dbvis.com/[DbVisualizer] 13.0 or higher
* {es-sql} <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>>

Note::
Pre 13.0 versions of DbVisualizer can still connect to {es} by having the <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>> set up from the generic *Custom* template.

==== Setup the {es} JDBC driver

Setup the {es} JDBC driver through *Tools* > *Driver Manager*:

Select *Elasticsearch* driver template from the left sidebar to create a new user driver:

Download the driver locally:

and check its availability status:

==== Create a new connection

Once the {es} driver is in place, create a new connection:

by double-clicking the {es} entry in the list of available drivers:

Enter the connection details, then press *Connect* and the driver version (as that of the cluster) should show up under *Connection Message*.

The setup is done. DbVisualizer can be used to run queries against {es} and explore its content:

=== Microsoft Power BI Desktop

You can use the {es} ODBC driver to access {es} data from Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application; for native Elasticsearch integration in this product, please reach out to its vendor.

==== Prerequisites

* https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/[Microsoft Power BI Desktop] 2.63 or higher
* {es-sql} <<sql-odbc, ODBC driver>>
* A preconfigured User or System DSN (see <<dsn-configuration,Configuration>> section on how to configure a DSN).

==== Data loading

First, you'll need to choose ODBC as the source to load data from. Once launched, click on the _Get Data_ button (under _Home_ tab), then
on the _More..._ button at the bottom of the list:

[[apps_pbi_fromodbc1]]
.Get Data / More...

In the new opened window scroll at the bottom of the _All_ list and select the _ODBC_ entry, then click on the _Connect_ button:

[[apps_pbi_fromodbc2]]
.ODBC / Connect

This will replace current window with a new _From ODBC_ one, where you'll have to select a previously configured DSN:

[[apps_pbi_dsn]]
.Choose a DSN

Once connected Power BI will read {es}'s catalog and offer the user a choice of tables (indices) to load data from. Clicking on one of the
tables will load a preview of the data within:

[[apps_pbi_picktable]]
.Pick table to load

Now tick the chosen table and click on the _Load_ button. Power BI will now load and analyze the data, populating a list with the available
columns. These can now be used to build the desired visualisation:

[[apps_pbi_loaded]]
.Visualize the data

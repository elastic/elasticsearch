You can use the {es} ODBC driver to access {es} data from Qlik Sense Desktop.

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application; for native Elasticsearch integration in this product, please reach out to its vendor.

==== Prerequisites

* https://www.qlik.com/us/try-or-buy/download-qlik-sense[Qlik Sense Desktop] November 2018 or higher
* {es-sql} <<sql-odbc, ODBC driver>>
* A preconfigured User or System DSN (see <<dsn-configuration,Configuration>> section on how to configure a DSN).

==== Data loading

To use the {odbc} to load data into Qlik Sense Desktop perform the following steps in sequence.

. Create new app

Provide a username and password in the respective fields, if authentication is enabled on your instance and if these are not already part
of the DSN. Press the _Create_ button.

=== SQL Workbench/J

You can use the {es} JDBC driver to access {es} data from SQL Workbench/J.

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application; for native Elasticsearch integration in this product, please reach out to its vendor.

==== Prerequisites

* https://www.sql-workbench.eu/[SQL Workbench/J] build 125 or higher
* {es-sql} <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>>

==== Add {es} JDBC driver

Add the {es} JDBC driver to SQL Workbench/J through *Manage Drivers* either from the main windows in the *File* menu or from the *Connect* window:

Select *Elasticsearch* profile from the left-hand side (if it is missing check the SQL Workbench/J version or add a new entry to the list through the blank page button in the upper left corner):

==== Create a new connection profile

With the driver configured, create a new connection profile through *File* > *Connect Window* (or Alt+C shortcut):

Select the previously configured driver and set the URL of your cluster using the JDBC syntax.
Verify the connection through the *Test* button - a confirmation window should appear that everything is properly configured.

The setup is complete.

==== Execute SQL queries

SQL Workbench/J is ready to talk to {es} through SQL: click on the profile created to execute statements or explore the data:

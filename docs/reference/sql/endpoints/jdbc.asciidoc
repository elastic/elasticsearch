== SQL JDBC

{es}'s SQL jdbc driver is a rich, fully featured JDBC driver for {es}.
It is Type 4 driver, meaning it is a platform independent, stand-alone, Direct to Database,
pure Java driver that converts JDBC calls to {es-sql}.

[[sql-jdbc-installation]]

=== Installation

The JDBC driver can be obtained from:

Dedicated page::
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/jdbc-client[elastic.co] provides links, typically for manual downloads.
Maven dependency::
https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]-compatible tools can retrieve it automatically as a dependency:

["source","xml",subs="attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.elasticsearch.plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>x-pack-sql-jdbc</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

from https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.elasticsearch.plugin/x-pack-sql-jdbc[Maven Central Repository],
or from `artifacts.elastic.co/maven` by adding it to the repositories list:

["source","xml",subs="attributes"]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>elastic.co</id>

[[jdbc-setup]]
[discrete]
=== Setup

The driver main class is `org.elasticsearch.xpack.sql.jdbc.EsDriver`.
Note the driver implements the JDBC 4.0 +Service Provider+ mechanism meaning it is registered automatically
as long as it is available in the classpath.

Once registered, the driver understands the following syntax as an URL:

["source","text",subs="attributes"]
----
jdbc:[es|elasticsearch]://[[http|https]://]?[host[:port]]?/[prefix]?[\?[option=value]&]*
----
`jdbc:[es|elasticsearch]://`:: Prefix. Mandatory.

`[[http|https]://]`:: Type of HTTP connection to make. Possible values are
`http` (default) or `https`. Optional.

`[host[:port]]`:: Host (`localhost` by default) and port (`9200` by default).
Optional.

`[prefix]`:: Prefix (empty by default). Typically used when hosting {es} under
a certain path. Optional.

`[option=value]`:: Properties for the JDBC driver. Empty by default.
Optional.

The driver recognized the following properties:

[[jdbc-cfg]]
[discrete]
===== Essential
[[jdbc-cfg-timezone]]
`timezone` (default JVM timezone)::
Timezone used by the driver _per connection_ indicated by its `ID`.
*Highly* recommended to set it (to, say, `UTC`) as the JVM timezone can vary, is global for the entire JVM and can't be changed easily when running under a security manager.

[[jdbc-cfg-network]]
[discrete]
===== Network

`connect.timeout` (default `30000`)::
Connection timeout (in milliseconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting to make a connection to the server.

`network.timeout` (default `60000`)::
Network timeout (in milliseconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting for the network.

`page.size` (default `1000`)::
Page size (in entries). The number of results returned per page by the server.

`page.timeout` (default `45000`)::
Page timeout (in milliseconds). Minimum retention period for the scroll cursor on the server. Queries that require
a stateful scroll cursor on the server side might fail after this timeout. Hence, when scrolling through large result sets,
processing `page.size` records should not take longer than `page.timeout` milliseconds.

`query.timeout` (default `90000`)::
Query timeout (in milliseconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting for a query to return.

[[jdbc-cfg-auth]]
[discrete]
==== Basic Authentication

`user`:: Basic Authentication user name

`password`:: Basic Authentication password

[[jdbc-cfg-ssl]]
[discrete]
==== SSL

`ssl` (default `false`):: Enable SSL

`ssl.keystore.location`:: key store (if used) location

`ssl.keystore.pass`:: key store password

`ssl.keystore.type` (default `JKS`):: key store type. `PKCS12` is a common, alternative format

`ssl.truststore.location`:: trust store location

`ssl.truststore.pass`:: trust store password

`ssl.truststore.type` (default `JKS`):: trust store type. `PKCS12` is a common, alternative format

`ssl.protocol`(default `TLS`):: SSL protocol to be used

[discrete]
==== Proxy

`proxy.http`:: Http proxy host name

`proxy.socks`:: SOCKS proxy host name

[discrete]
==== Mapping
`field.multi.value.leniency` (default `true`):: Whether to be lenient and return the first value (without any guarantees of what that
will be - typically the first in natural ascending order) for fields with multiple values (true) or throw an exception.

[discrete]
==== Index
`index.include.frozen` (default `false`):: Whether to include frozen indices in the query execution or not (default).

[discrete]
==== Cluster
`catalog`:: Default catalog (cluster) for queries. If unspecified, the
queries execute on the data in the local cluster only.
+
experimental:[] See <<modules-cross-cluster-search,{ccs}>>.

[discrete]
==== Additional

`validate.properties` (default `true`):: If disabled, it will ignore any misspellings or unrecognizable properties. When enabled, an exception
will be thrown if the provided property cannot be recognized.


To put all of it together, the following URL:

["source","text"]
----
jdbc:es://http://server:3456/?timezone=UTC&page.size=250
----

opens up a {es-sql} connection to `server` on port `3456`, setting the JDBC connection timezone to `UTC` and its pagesize to `250` entries.

=== API usage

One can use JDBC through the official `java.sql` and `javax.sql` packages:

[[java-sql]]
==== `java.sql`
The former through `java.sql.Driver` and `DriverManager`:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/JdbcIntegrationTestCase.java[connect-dm]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. The port is by default 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

[[javax-sql]]
==== `javax.sql`

Accessible through the `javax.sql.DataSource` API:
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/JdbcIntegrationTestCase.java[connect-ds]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. By default 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

Which one to use? Typically client applications that provide most
configuration properties in the URL rely on the `DriverManager`-style
while `DataSource` is preferred when being _passed_ around since it can be
configured in one place and the consumer only has to call `getConnection`
without having to worry about any other properties.

To connect to a secured Elasticsearch server the `Properties`
should look like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{security-tests}/JdbcSecurityIT.java[admin_properties]
--------------------------------------------------

Once you have the connection you can use it like any other JDBC
connection. For example:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/SimpleExampleTestCase.java[simple_example]
--------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
{es-sql} doesn't provide a connection pooling mechanism, thus the connections
the JDBC driver creates are not pooled. In order to achieve pooled connections,
a third-party connection pooling mechanism is required. Configuring and setting up the
third-party provider is outside the scope of this documentation.

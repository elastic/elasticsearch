[[sql-jdbc]]
== SQL JDBC

{es}'s SQL jdbc driver is a rich, fully featured JDBC driver for {es}.
It is Type 4 driver, meaning it is a platform independent, stand-alone, Direct to Database,
pure Java driver that converts JDBC calls to {es-sql}.

[[sql-jdbc-installation]]
[float]
=== Installation

The JDBC driver can be obtained from:

Dedicated page::
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/jdbc-client[elastic.co] provides links, typically for manual downloads.
Maven dependency::
http://maven.apache.org/[Maven]-compatible tools can retrieve it automatically as a dependency:

["source","xml",subs="attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.elasticsearch.plugin</groupId>
  <artifactId>x-pack-sql-jdbc</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

from `artifacts.elastic.co/maven` by adding it to the repositories list:

["source","xml",subs="attributes"]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>elastic.co</id>
    <url>https://artifacts.elastic.co/maven</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----

[[jdbc-setup]]
[float]
=== Setup

The driver main class is `org.elasticsearch.xpack.sql.jdbc.EsDriver`. 
Note the driver  implements the JDBC 4.0 +Service Provider+ mechanism meaning it is registered automatically
as long as it is available in the classpath.

Once registered, the driver understands the following syntax as an URL:

["source","text",subs="attributes"]
----
jdbc:es://<1>[http|https]?<2>[host[:port]]*<3>/[prefix]*<4>[?[option=value]&<5>]*
----

<1> `jdbc:es://` prefix. Mandatory.
<2> type of HTTP connection to make - `http` (default) or `https`. Optional.
<3> host (`localhost` by default) and port (`9200` by default). Optional.
<4> prefix (empty by default). Typically used when hosting {es} under a certain path. Optional.
<5> Parameters for the JDBC driver. Empty by default. Optional.

The driver recognized the following parameters:

[[jdbc-cfg]]
[float]
===== Essential

`timezone` (default JVM timezone)::
Timezone used by the driver _per connection_ indicated by its `ID`. 
*Highly* recommended to set it (to, say, `UTC`) as the JVM timezone can vary, is global for the entire JVM and can't be changed easily when running under a security manager.

[[jdbc-cfg-network]]
[float]
===== Network

`connect.timeout` (default 30s)::
Connection timeout (in seconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting to make a connection to the server.

`network.timeout` (default 60s)::
Network timeout (in seconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting for the network.

`page.timeout` (default 45s)::
Page timeout (in seconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting for a page.

`page.size` (default 1000)::
Page size (in entries). The number of results returned per page by the server.

`query.timeout` (default 90s)::
Query timeout (in seconds). That is the maximum amount of time waiting for a query to return.

[[jdbc-cfg-auth]]
[float]
==== Basic Authentication

`user`:: Basic Authentication user name

`password`:: Basic Authentication password

[[jdbc-cfg-ssl]]
[float]
==== SSL

`ssl` (default false):: Enable SSL

`ssl.keystore.location`:: key store (if used) location

`ssl.keystore.pass`:: key store password

`ssl.keystore.type` (default `JKS`):: key store type. `PKCS12` is a common, alternative format

`ssl.truststore.location`:: trust store location

`ssl.truststore.pass`:: trust store password

`ssl.cert.allow.self.signed` (default `false`):: Whether or not to allow self signed certificates

`ssl.protocol`(default `TLS`):: SSL protocol to be used

[float]
==== Proxy

`proxy.http`:: Http proxy host name

`proxy.socks`:: SOCKS proxy host name


To put all of it together, the following URL:

["source","text"]
----
jdbc:es://http://server:3456/?timezone=UTC&page.size=250
----

Opens up a {es-sql} connection to `server` on port `3456`, setting the JDBC connection timezone to `UTC` and its pagesize to `250` entries.

=== API usage

One can use JDBC through the official `java.sql` and `javax.sql` packages:

==== `java.sql`
The former through `java.sql.Driver` and `DriverManager`:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/JdbcIntegrationTestCase.java[connect-dm]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. The port is by default 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

==== `javax.sql`

Accessible through the `javax.sql.DataSource` API:
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/JdbcIntegrationTestCase.java[connect-ds]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The server and port on which Elasticsearch is listening for
HTTP traffic. By default 9200.
<2> Properties for connecting to Elasticsearch. An empty `Properties`
instance is fine for unsecured Elasticsearch.

Which one to use? Typically client applications that provide most
configuration parameters in the URL rely on the `DriverManager`-style
while `DataSource` is preferred when being _passed_ around since it can be
configured in one place and the consumer only has to call `getConnection`
without having to worry about any other parameters.

To connect to a secured Elasticsearch server the `Properties`
should look like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{security-tests}/JdbcSecurityIT.java[admin_properties]
--------------------------------------------------

Once you have the connection you can use it like any other JDBC
connection. For example:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{jdbc-tests}/SimpleExampleTestCase.java[simple_example]
--------------------------------------------------

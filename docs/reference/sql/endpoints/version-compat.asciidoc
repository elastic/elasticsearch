| Example

ifeval::[ "{major-version}" == "8.x" ]

ifeval::[ "{minor-version}" != "8.0" ]
| 8.0.0â€“{version}
| * The same version
  * Any earlier 8.x version
  * Any 7.x version after 7.7.0.
| An {version} server is compatible with {version} and earlier 8.x drivers. An
{version} server is also compatible with 7.7.0 and later 7.x drivers.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{minor-version}" == "8.0" ]
| 8.0.0
| * The same version
  * Any 7.x version after 7.7.0.
| An 8.0.0 server is compatible with 8.0.0 drivers. An 8.0.0 server is also
compatible with 7.7.0 and later 7.x drivers.
endif::[]

| 7.7.1-{prev-major-last}
| * The same version
  * An earlier 7.x version, back to 7.7.0.
| A 7.10.0 server is compatible with 7.7.0-7.10.0 drivers.

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{major-version}" == "7.x" ]
| 7.7.1-{version}
| * The same version
  * An earlier 7.x version, back to 7.7.0.
| A 7.10.0 server is compatible with 7.7.0-7.10.0 drivers.
endif::[]

| 7.7.0 and earlier versions
| * The same version.
| A 7.6.1 server is only compatible with 7.6.1 drivers.

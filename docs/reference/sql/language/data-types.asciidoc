[NOTE]
Most of {es} <<mapping-types, data types>> are available in {es-sql}, as indicated above.
As one can see, all of {es} <<mapping-types, data types>> are mapped to the data type with the same
name in {es-sql}, with the exception of **date** data type which is mapped to **datetime** in {es-sql}.
This is to avoid confusion with the ANSI SQL types **DATE** (date only) and **TIME** (time only), which are also
supported by {es-sql} in queries (with the use of
<<sql-functions-type-conversion-cast>>/<<sql-functions-type-conversion-convert>>), but don't correspond to an
actual mapping in {es} (see the <<es-sql-only-types, `table`>> below).

Obviously, not all types in {es} have an equivalent in SQL and vice-versa hence why, {es-sql}
uses the data type _particularities_ of the former over the latter as ultimately {es} is the backing store.

In addition to the types above, {es-sql} also supports at _runtime_ SQL-specific types that do not have an equivalent in {es}.
Such types cannot be loaded from {es} (as it does not know about them) however can be used inside {es-sql} in queries or their results.

[[es-sql-only-types]]

The table below indicates these types:

[[sql-multi-field]]
[float]
==== SQL and multi-fields

A core concept in {es} is that of an `analyzed` field, that is a full-text value that is interpreted in order
to be effectively indexed. These fields are of type <<text, `text`>> and are not used for sorting or aggregations as their actual value depends on the <<analyzer, `analyzer`>> used hence why {es} also offers the <<keyword, `keyword`>> type for storing the _exact_
value.

In most case, and the default actually, is to use both types when for strings which {es} supports through <<multi-fields, multi fields>>, that is the ability to index the same string in multiple ways; for example index it both as `text` for search but also as `keyword` for sorting and aggregations.

As SQL requires exact values, when encountering a `text` field {es-sql} will search for an exact multi-field that it can use for comparisons, sorting and aggregations.
To do that, it will search for the first `keyword` that it can find that is _not_ normalized and use that as the original field _exact_ value.

Consider the following `string` mapping:

[source, js]
----
{
    "first_name" : {
        "type" : "text",
        "fields" : {
            "raw" : {
                "type" : "keyword"
            }
        }
    }
}
----
// NOTCONSOLE

The following SQL query:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT first_name FROM index WHERE first_name = 'John'
----

is identical to:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT first_name FROM index WHERE first_name.raw = 'John'
----

as {es-sql} automatically _picks_ up the `raw` multi-field from `raw` for exact matching.

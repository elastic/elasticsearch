The synonyms management API provides a convenient way to define and manage synonyms in an internal system index. Related synonyms can be grouped in a "synonyms set".
Create as many synonym sets as you need.

This provides an alternative to:

- Defining inline synonyms in an analyzer definition, which impacts mapping size and can lead to performance issues.
- Using synonyms files, which implies uploading and managing file consistency on all cluster nodes.

Synonyms sets can be used to configure <<analysis-synonym-graph-tokenfilter,synonym graph token filters>> and <<analysis-synonym-tokenfilter,synonym token filters>>.
These filters are applied as part of the <<analysis,analysis>> process by the <<search-analyzer,search analyzer>>.

Your search results will immediately reflect the synonyms set changes.

* <<get-synonyms-set>>
* <<list-synonyms-sets>>

[[synonym-rules-apis]]
=== Synonym rules APIs

Synonyms sets are composed of synonym rules.
Each synonym rule defines a group of words that act as synonyms.
You can update individual synonym rules for a specific synonyms set instead of updating the complete synonyms set.

Use the following APIs to manage individual synonym rules in a synonyms set:

* <<put-synonym-rule>>
* <<get-synonym-rule>>
* <<delete-synonym-rule>>

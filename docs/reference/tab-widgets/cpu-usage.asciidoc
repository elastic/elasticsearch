From your deployment menu, click **Performance**. The page's **CPU Usage** chart
shows your deployment's CPU usage as a percentage.

High CPU usage can also deplete your CPU credits. CPU credits let {ess} provide
smaller clusters with a performance boost when needed. The **CPU credits**
chart shows your remaining CPU credits, measured in seconds of CPU time.

You can also use the <<cat-nodes,cat nodes API>> to get the current CPU usage
for each node.

// tag::cpu-usage-cat-nodes[]
[source,console]

The response's `cpu` column contains the current CPU usage as a percentage. The
`node` column contains the node's name.

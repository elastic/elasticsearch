<1> The task type is `text_embedding` in the path and the `inference_id` which 
is the unique identifier of the {infer} endpoint is `cohere_embeddings`.
<2> The API key of your Cohere account. You can find your API keys in your
Cohere dashboard under the
https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys[API keys section]. You need to provide
your API key only once. The <<get-inference-api>> does not return your API
key.
<3> The name of the embedding model to use. You can find the list of Cohere
embedding models https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed[here].

NOTE: When using this model the recommended similarity measure to use in the
`dense_vector` field mapping is `dot_product`. In the case of Cohere models, the
embeddings are normalized to unit length in which case the `dot_product` and
the `cosine` measures are equivalent.

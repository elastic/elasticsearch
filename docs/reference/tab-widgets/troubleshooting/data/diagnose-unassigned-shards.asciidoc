In order to diagnose the unassigned shards, follow the next steps:

**Use {kib}**

//tag::kibana-api-ex[]
. Log in to the {ess-console}[{ecloud} console].
+

. On the **Elasticsearch Service** panel, click the name of your deployment. 
+

NOTE: If the name of your deployment is disabled your {kib} instances might be
unhealthy, in which case please contact https://support.elastic.co[Elastic Support].
If your deployment doesn't include {kib}, all you need to do is 
{cloud}/ec-access-kibana.html[enable it first].

. Open your deployment's side navigation menu (placed under the Elastic logo in the upper left corner)
and go to **Dev Tools > Console**.

. View the unassigned shards using the <<cat-shards,cat shards API>>.

GET _cat/shards?v=true&h=index,shard,prirep,state,node,unassigned.reason&s=state

Unassigned shards have a `state` of `UNASSIGNED`. The `prirep` value is `p` for
primary shards and `r` for replicas.
+
The index in the example has a primary shard unassigned.

. To understand why an unassigned shard is not being assigned and what action
you must take to allow {es} to assign it, use the
<<cluster-allocation-explain,cluster allocation explanation API>>.

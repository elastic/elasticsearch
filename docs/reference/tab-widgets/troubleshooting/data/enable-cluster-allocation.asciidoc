In order to get the shards assigned we'll need to change the value of the
<<cluster-routing-allocation-enable, configuration>> that restricts the 
assignemnt of the shards to allow all shards to be allocated.

We'll achieve this by inspecting the system-wide `cluster.routing.allocation.enable` 
<<cluster-get-settings, cluster setting>> and changing the configured value to 
`all`.

**Use {kib}**

//tag::kibana-api-ex[]
. Log in to the {ess-console}[{ecloud} console].
+

. On the **Elasticsearch Service** panel, click the name of your deployment. 
+

NOTE: If the name of your deployment is disabled your {kib} instances might be
unhealthy, in which case please contact https://support.elastic.co[Elastic Support].
If your deployment doesn't include {kib}, all you need to do is 
{cloud}/ec-access-kibana.html[enable it first].

. Open your deployment's side navigation menu (placed under the Elastic logo in the upper left corner)
and go to **Dev Tools > Console**.

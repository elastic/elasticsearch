# Token filter reference [analysis-tokenfilters]

Token filters accept a stream of tokens from a [tokenizer](/reference/text-analysis/tokenizer-reference.md) and can modify tokens (eg lowercasing), delete tokens (eg remove stopwords) or add tokens (eg synonyms).

{{es}} has a number of built-in token filters you can use to build [custom analyzers](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/text-analysis/create-custom-analyzer.md).

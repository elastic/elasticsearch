To use the {transforms}, you must have the
{subscriptions}[appropriate license] and at least one
<<transform-setup-nodes,{transform} node>> in your {es} cluster. If {stack}
{security-features} are enabled, you must also ensure your users have the
<<transform-privileges,necessary privileges>>.

[[transform-setup-nodes]]
== {transform-cap} nodes

To use {transforms}, there must be at least one {transform} node in your cluster.
If you want to control which nodes run {transforms}, add or remove `transform`
from the `node.roles` setting on some nodes. For more information, see
<<modules-node>> and <<transform-settings>>.

[[transform-privileges]]
== Security privileges

The {es} {security-features} provide <<built-in-roles,built-in roles>>
and <<security-privileges,privileges>> that make it easier to control
which users can manage or view {transforms}.

To _view_ the configuration and status of {transforms}, you must have:

* `transform_user` built-in role or `monitor_transform`
cluster privileges

To _manage_ {transforms}, you must have:

* `transform_admin` built-in role or `manage_transform`
cluster privileges
* `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on source indices
* `read`, `create_index`, and `index` index privileges on destination indices

For more information, see <<security-privileges>> and <<built-in-roles>>.

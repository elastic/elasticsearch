[[requirements-overview]]
== Requirements overview

To use {transforms}, you must have:

* at least one <<transform-node,{transform} node>>,
* management features visible in the {kib} space, and
* security privileges that:
+
--
* grant use of {transforms}, and
* grant access to source and destination indices
--

[[transform-privileges]]
== Security privileges

Assigning security privileges affects how users access {transforms}. Consider
the two main categories:

* *<<transform-es-security-privileges>>*: uses an {es} client, cURL, or {kib}
**{dev-tools-app}** to access {transforms} via {es} APIs. This scenario requires
{es} security privileges.
* *<<transform-kib-security-privileges>>*: uses {transforms} in {kib}. This
scenario requires {kib} feature privileges _and_ {es} security privileges.

=== {es} API user

To _manage_ {transforms}, you must meet all of the following requirements:

* `transform_admin` built-in role or `manage_transform` cluster privileges,
* `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on source indices, and
* `create_index`, `index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges on destination
indices. If a `retention_policy` is configured, `delete` index privilege is
also required on the destination index.

To view only the configuration and status of {transforms}, you must have:

* `transform_user` built-in role or `monitor_transform` cluster privileges

For more information about {es} roles and privileges, refer to
<<built-in-roles>> and <<security-privileges>>.

[[transform-kib-security-privileges]]
=== {kib} user

Within a {kib} space, for full access to {transforms}, you must meet all of the
following requirements:

*  Management features visible in the {kib} space, including
`Data View Management` and `Stack Monitoring`,
* `monitoring_user` built-in role,
* `transform_admin` built-in role or `manage_transform` cluster privileges,
* `kibana_admin` built-in role or a custom role with `read` or `all` {kib}
privileges for the `Data View Management` feature (dependent on whether data
views already exist for your destination indices),
* data views for your source indices,
* `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on source indices, and
* `create_index`, `index`, `manage`, and `read` index privileges on destination
indices. Additionally, when using a `retention_policy`, `delete` index privilege is required
on destination indices.
* `read_pipeline` cluster privileges, if the {transform} uses an ingest pipeline

Within a {kib} space, for read-only access to {transforms}, you must meet all of
the following requirements:

* Management features visible in the {kib} space, including `Stack Monitoring`,
* `monitoring_user` built-in role,
* `transform_user` built-in role or `monitor_transform` cluster privileges,
* `kibana_admin` built-in role or a custom role with `read` {kib} privileges
for at least one feature in the space,
* data views for your source and destination indices, and
* `read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on source indices and
destination indices

For more information and {kib} security features, see
{kibana-ref}/kibana-role-management.html[{kib} role management] and
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[{kib} privileges].

[[transform-kib-spaces]]
== {kib} spaces

{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces] enable you to organize your source and
destination indices and other saved objects in {kib} and to see only the objects
that belong to your space. However, a {transform} is a long running task which 
is managed on cluster level and therefore not limited in scope to certain 
spaces. Space awareness can be implemented for a {data-source} under 
**Stack Management > Kibana** which allows privileges to the {transform} 
destination index.

To successfully create {transforms} in {kib}, you must be logged into a space
where the source indices are visible and the `Data View Management` and
`Stack Monitoring` features are visible.

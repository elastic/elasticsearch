= Working with {transforms} at scale
++++
<titleabbrev>{transforms-cap} at scale</titleabbrev>
++++

{transforms-cap} convert existing {es} indices into summarized indices, which 
provide opportunities for new insights and analytics. The search and index 
operations performed by {transforms} use standard {es} features so similar 
considerations for working with {es} at scale are often applicable to 
{transforms}. If you experience performance issues, start by identifying the 
bottleneck areas (search, indexing, processing, or storage) then review the 
relevant considerations in this guide to improve performance. It also helps to 
understand how {transforms} work as different considerations apply depending on 
whether or not your transform is running in continuous mode or in batch.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Understand the impact of configuration options on the performance of 
  {transforms}.

**Prerequisites:**

These guildelines assume you have a {transform} you want to tune, and you’re 
already familiar with: 

* <<transform-overview,How {transforms} work>>.
* <<transform-setup,How to set up {transforms}>>.
* <<transform-checkpoints,How {transform} checkpoints work in continuous mode>>.

The following considerations are not sequential – the numbers help to navigate 
between the list items; you can take action on one or more of them in any order. 
Most of the recommendations apply to both continuous and batch {transforms}. If 
a list item only applies to one {transform} type, this exception is highlighted 
in the description.

The keywords in parenthesis at the end of each recommendation title indicates 
the bottleneck area that may be improved by following the given recommendation.

[[measure-performance]]
== Measure {transforms} performance

In order to optimize {transform} performance, start by identifying the areas 
where most work is being done. The **Stats** interface of the 
**{transforms-cap}** page in {kib} contains information that covers three main 
areas: indexing, searching, and processing time (alternatively, you can use the 
<<get-transform-stats, {transforms} stats API>>). If, for example, the results 
show that the highest proportion of time is spent on search, then prioritize 
efforts on optimizing the search query of the {transform}. {transforms-cap} also 
has https://esrally.readthedocs.io[Rally support] that makes it possible to run 
performance checks on {transforms} configurations if it is required. If you 
optimized the crucial factors and you still experience performance issues, you 
may also want to consider improving your hardware.


[discrete]
[[frequency]]
== 1. Optimize `frequency` (index)

In a {ctransform}, the `frequency` configuration option sets the interval 
between checks for changes in the source indices. If changes are detected, then 
the source data is searched and the changes are applied to the destination 
index. Depending on your use case, you may wish to reduce the frequency at which 
changes are applied. By setting `frequency` to a higher value (maximum is one 
hour), the workload can be spread over time at the cost of less up-to-date data.


[discrete]
[[increase-shards-dest-index]]
== 2. Increase the number of shards of the destination index (index)

Depending on the size of the destination index, you may consider increasing its 
shard count. {transforms-cap} use one shard by default when creating the 
destination index. To override the index settings, create the destination index 
before starting the {transform}. For more information about how the number of 
shards affects scalability and resilience, refer to <<scalability>>

TIP: Use the <<preview-transform>> to check the settings that the {transform} 
would use to create the destination index. You can copy and adjust these in 
order to create the destination index prior to starting the {transform}.


[discrete]
[[search-queries]]
== 3. Profile and optimize your search queries (search)

If you have defined a {transform} source index `query`, ensure it is as 
efficient as possible. Use the **Search Profiler** under **Dev Tools** in {kib} 
to get detailed timing information about the execution of individual components 
in the search request. Alternatively, you can use the <<search-profile>>. The 
results give you insight into how search requests are executed at a low level so 
that you can understand why certain requests are slow, and take steps to improve 
them.

{transforms-cap} execute standard {es} search requests. There are different ways 
to write {es} queries, and some of them are more efficient than others. Consult 
<<tune-for-search-speed>> to learn more about {es} performance tuning.


[discrete]
[[limit-source-query]]
== 4. Limit the scope of the source query (search)

Imagine your {ctransform} is configured to group by `IP` and calculate the sum 
of `bytes_sent`. For each checkpoint, a {ctransform} detects changes in the 
source data since the previous checkpoint, identifying the IPs for which new 
data has been ingested. Then it performs a second search, filtered for this 
group of IPs, in order to calculate the total `bytes_sent`. If this second 
search matches many shards, then this could be resource intensive. Consider 
limiting the scope that the source index pattern and query will match.

Use an absolute time value as a date range filter in your source query (for 
example, greater than `2020-01-01T00:00:00`) to limit which historical indices 
are accessed. If you use a relative time value (for example, `now-30d`) then 
this date range is re-evaluated at the point of each checkpoint execution.


[discrete]
[[optimize-shading-strategy]]
== 5. Optimize the sharding strategy for the source index (search)

There is no one-size-fits-all sharding strategy. A strategy that works in one 
environment may not scale in another. A good sharding strategy must account for 
your infrastructure, use case, and performance expectations.

Too few shards may mean that the benefits of distributing the workload cannot be 
realised; however too many shards may impact your cluster health. To learn more 
about sizing your shards, read this <<size-your-shards,guide>>.


[discrete]
[[tune-max-page-search-size]]
== 6. Tune `max_page_search_size` (search)

The `max_page_search_size` {transform} configuration option defines the number 
of buckets that are returned for each search request. The default value is 500. 
If you increase this value, you get better throughput at the cost of higher 
latency and memory usage.

The ideal value of this parameter is highly dependent on your use case. If your 
{transform} executes memory-intensive aggregations – for example, cardinality or 
percentiles – then increasing `max_page_search_size` requires more available 
memory. If memory limits are exceeded, a circuit breaker exception occurs.


[discrete]
[[indexed-fields-in-source]]
== 7. Use indexed fields in your source indices (search)

Runtime fields and scripted fields are not indexed fields; their values are only 
extracted or computed at search time. While these fields provide flexibility in 
how you access your data, they increase performance costs at search time. If 
{transform} performance using runtime fields or scripted fields is a concern, 
you may wish to consider using indexed fields instead. For performance reasons, 
we do not recommend using a runtime field as the time field that synchronizes a 
{ctransform}. 


[discrete]
[[index-sorting-group-by-ordering]]
== 8. Use index sorting and `group_by` ordering (search, process)

If you use more than one `group_by` field in your {transform}, then the order of 
the fields in conjunction with the use of <<index-modules-index-sorting>> may 
improve runtime.

Index sorting enables you to store documents on disk in a specific order which 
can improve query efficiency. The ideal sorting logic depends on your use case, 
but the rule of thumb may be to sort the fields in descending order (high to low 
cardinality) starting with the time-based fields. Then put the time-based 
components first in the `group_by` if you have any, and then apply the same 
order to your `group_by` fields as configured for index sorting. Index sorting 
can be defined only once at index creation. If you don't already have index 
sorting on the index that you want to use as a source, consider reindexing it to 
a new, sorted index.


[discrete]
[[disable-source-dest]]
== 9. Disable the `_source` field on the destination index (storage)

The <<mapping-source-field>> contains the original JSON document body that was 
passed at index time. The `_source` field itself is not indexed (and thus is not 
searchable), but it is still stored in the index and incurs a storage overhead. 
Consider disabling `_source` to save storage space if you have a large 
destination index. Disabling `_source` is only possible during index creation.

NOTE: When the `_source` field is disabled, a number of features are not 
supported. Consult <<disable-source-field>> to understand the consequences 
before disabling it.

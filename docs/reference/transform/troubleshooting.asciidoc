If you encounter problems with your {transforms}, you can gather more
information from the following files and APIs:

* Lightweight audit messages are stored in `.transform-notifications-read`. Search
by your `transform_id`.
* The <<get-transform-stats,get {transform} statistics API>> provides
information about the {transform} status and failures.
* If the {transform} exists as a task, you can use the
<<tasks,task management API>> to gather task information. For example:
`GET _tasks?actions=data_frame/transforms*&detailed`. Typically, the task exists
when the {transform} is in a started or failed state.
* The {es} logs from the node that was running the {transform} might
also contain useful information. You can identify the node from the notification
messages. Alternatively, if the task still exists, you can get that information
from the get {transform} statistics API. For more information, see
<<logging>>.

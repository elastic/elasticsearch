=== Rejected requests

When {es} rejects a request, it stops the operation and returns an error with a
`429` response code. Rejected requests are commonly caused by:

* A <<high-cpu-usage,depleted thread pool>>. A depleted `search` or `write`
thread pool returns a `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` error message.

* A <<circuit-breaker-errors,circuit breaker error>>.

* High <<index-modules-indexing-pressure,indexing pressure>> that exceeds the
<<memory-limits,`indexing_pressure.memory.limit`>>.

==== Check rejected tasks

To check the number of rejected tasks for each thread pool, use the
<<cat-thread-pool,cat thread pool API>>. A high ratio of `rejected` to
`completed` tasks, particularly in the `search` and `write` thread pools, means
{es} regularly rejects requests.

[source,console]
----
GET /_cat/thread_pool?v=true&h=id,name,queue,active,rejected,completed
----

`write` thread pool rejections frequently appear in the erring API and
correlating log as `EsRejectedExecutionException` with either
`QueueResizingEsThreadPoolExecutor` or `queue capacity`.

These errors are often related to <<task-queue-backlog,backlogged tasks>>.

[[check-circuit-breakers]]
==== Check circuit breakers

To check the number of tripped <<circuit-breaker,circuit breakers>>, use the
<<cluster-nodes-stats,node stats API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET /_nodes/stats/breaker
----

These statistics are cumulative from node startup. For more information, see
<<circuit-breaker,circuit breaker errors>>.

[[check-indexing-pressure]]
==== Check indexing pressure

To check the number of <<index-modules-indexing-pressure,indexing pressure>>
rejections, use the <<cluster-nodes-stats,node stats API>>.

[source,console]
----
GET _nodes/stats?human&filter_path=nodes.*.indexing_pressure
----

These stats are cumulative from node startup. 

Indexing pressure rejections appear as an
`EsRejectedExecutionException`, and indicate that they were rejected due
to `coordinating_and_primary_bytes`, `coordinating`, `primary`, or `replica`.

These errors are often related to <<task-queue-backlog,backlogged tasks>>,
<<docs-bulk,bulk index>> sizing, or the ingest target's
<<index-modules,`refresh_interval` setting>>.

**Fix high CPU and memory usage**

If {es} regularly rejects requests and other tasks, your cluster likely has high
CPU usage or high JVM memory pressure. For tips, see <<high-cpu-usage>> and
<<high-jvm-memory-pressure>>.

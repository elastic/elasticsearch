=== Task queue backlog

A backlogged task queue can prevent tasks from completing and 
put the cluster into an unhealthy state. 
Resource constraints, a large number of tasks being triggered at once,
and long running tasks can all contribute to a backlogged task queue.

**Check the thread pool status**

A <<high-cpu-usage,depleted thread pool>> can result in <<rejected-requests,rejected requests>>. 

You can use the <<cat-thread-pool,cat thread pool API>> to 
see the number of active threads in each thread pool and
how many tasks are queued, how many have been rejected, and how many have completed. 

[source,console]
----
GET /_cat/thread_pool?v&s=t,n&h=type,name,node_name,active,queue,rejected,completed
----

**Inspect the hot threads on each node**

If a particular thread pool queue is backed up, 
you can periodically poll the <<cluster-nodes-hot-threads,Nodes hot threads>> API 
to determine if the thread has sufficient 
resources to progress and gauge how quickly it is progressing.

[source,console]
----
GET /_nodes/hot_threads
----

**Look for long running tasks**

Long-running tasks can also cause a backlog. 
You can use the <<tasks,task management>> API to get information about the tasks that are running. 
Check the `running_time_in_nanos` to identify tasks that are taking an excessive amount of time to complete. 

[source,console]
----
GET /_tasks?filter_path=nodes.*.tasks

**Increase available resources** 

If tasks are progressing slowly and the queue is backing up, 
you might need to take steps to <<reduce-cpu-usage>>. 

In some cases, increasing the thread pool size might help.
For example, the `force_merge` thread pool defaults to a single thread.
Increasing the size to 2 might help reduce a backlog of force merge requests.

**Cancel stuck tasks**

If you find the active task's hot thread isn't progressing and there's a backlog, 
consider canceling the task.

Elasticsearch tries to take advantage of all the available resources by 
distributing data (index shards) amongst the cluster nodes.

Users might want to influence this data distribution by configuring the 
<<cluster-total-shards-per-node,`cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node`>>
system setting to restrict the number of shards that can be hosted on a single
node in the system, regardless of the index.
Various configurations limiting how many shards can be hosted on a single node 
can lead to shards being unassigned due to the cluster not having enough nodes to
satisfy the configuration.

In order to fix this follow the next steps:

== Addressing repeated snapshot policy failures

Repeated snapshot failures are usually an indicator of a problem with your deployment. Continuous failures of automated
snapshots can leave a deployment without recovery options in cases of data loss or outages.

Elasticsearch keeps track of the number of repeated failures when executing automated snapshots. If an automated
snapshot fails too many times without a successful execution, the health API will report a warning. The number of
repeated failures before reporting a warning is controlled by the
<<slm-health-failed-snapshot-warn-threshold,`slm.health.failed_snapshot_warn_threshold`>> setting.

In the event that an automated {slm} policy execution is experiencing repeated failures, follow these steps to get more
information about the problem:

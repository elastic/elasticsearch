[[upgrade-pre-release]]
IMPORTANT: This documentation is for a pre-release of {es} {minor-version}. 
Upgrades from pre-release builds are not supported and
could result in errors or data loss. 
If you upgrade from a released version to a pre-release verion for testing, 
discard the contents of the cluster when you are done.
Do not attempt to upgrade to the final release. 
endif::[]

{es} can usually be upgraded using a <<rolling-upgrades,Rolling upgrade>>
process so upgrading does not interrupt service. Rolling upgrades are supported:

// tag::rolling-upgrade-versions[]
* Between minor versions of the same major version
* From 5.6 to 6.8
* From 6.8 to {prev-major-version}
* From {prev-major-version} to {version}
ifeval::[ "{bare_version}" != "{minor-version}.0" ]
* From any version since {minor-version}.0 to {version}
endif::[]
// end::rolling-upgrade-versions[]

[TIP]
====
For rolling upgrades between major versions, we recommend
using the {kibana-ref}/upgrade-assistant.html[Kibana Upgrade Assistant].

The upgrade assistant identifies deprecated settings in your cluster and guides
you through the process of resolving issues, including reindexing.

We also recommend checking your <<deprecation-logging,deprecation logs>> for any
other functionality that may have changed.

[WARNING]
====
The upgrade path from 6.8 to 7.0 is *not* supported (both full cluster restart and rolling upgrade).
====

To upgrade directly to {version} from 6.7 or earlier, you must shut down the
cluster, install {version}, and restart. For more information, see
<<restart-upgrade, Full cluster restart upgrade>>.

[[upgrade-downgrade]]
=== Downgrades

In-place downgrades to earlier versions are *not* supported. To downgrade to an
earlier version, <<snapshots-restore-snapshot,restore a snapshot>> taken prior
to the version upgrade.

[[upgrade-index-compatibility]]
=== Index compatibility

{es} can read indices created in the previous major version. If you
have indices created in 5.x or before, you must reindex or delete them
before upgrading to {version}. {es} nodes will fail to start if
incompatible indices are present. Snapshots of 5.x or earlier indices cannot be
restored to a 7.x cluster even if they were created by a 6.x cluster. For
information about upgrading old indices, see <<reindex-upgrade, Reindex to upgrade>>.

When upgrading to a new version of {es}, you need to upgrade each
of the products in your Elastic Stack. For more information, see the
{stack-ref}/upgrading-elastic-stack.html[Elastic Stack Installation and Upgrade Guide].

[[upgrade-rest-api-compatibility]]
=== REST API compatibility

REST API compatibility in a per-request opt-in feature that can help REST clients
mitigate non compatible (breaking) changes to the REST API.
See <<rest-api-compatibility>> for additional information.

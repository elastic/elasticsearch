Use the `jira` action to create issues in https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira[Atlassian's Jira Software].
To create issues you need to <<configuring-jira, configure at least one Jira account>> in `elasticsearch.yml`.

[[configuring-jira-actions]]
==== Configuring Jira actions

You configure Jira actions in the `actions` array. Action-specific attributes
are specified using the `jira` keyword.

The following snippet shows a simple jira action definition:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"actions" : {
  "create-jira-issue" : {
    "transform" : { ... },
    "throttle_period" : "5m",
    "jira" : {
      "account" : "integration-account", <1>
      "fields" : {
          "project" : {
            "key": "PROJ" <2>
          },
          "issuetype" : {
            "name": "Bug" <3>
          },
          "summary" : "Encountered {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors in the last 5 minutes", <4>
          "description" : "Encountered {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors in the last 5 minutes (facepalm)", <5>
          "labels" : ["auto"], <6>
          "priority" : {
            "name" : "High" <7>
          }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
<1> The name of a Jira account configured in `elasticsearch.yml`.
<2> The key of the Jira project in which the issue will be created.
<3> The name of the issue type.
<4> The summary of the Jira issue.
<5> The description of the Jira issue.
<6> The labels to apply to the Jira issue.
<7> The priority of the Jira issue.

[[jira-action-attributes]]
==== Jira action attributes

Depending of how Jira projects are configured, the issues can have many different fields and values. Therefore
the `jira` action can accept any type of sub fields within its `issue` field. These fields will be directly used
when calling Jira's https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-createIssue[Create Issue API], allowing
 any type of custom fields to be used.

NOTE: The `project.key` (or `project.id`), the `issuetype.name` (or `issuetype.id`) and `issue.summary` are
always required to create an issue in Jira.

[cols=",^,", options="header"]
|======
| Name                     |Required | Description

| `account`                 | no      | The Jira account to use to send the message.

                                       It can be replaced by `issue.project.id` if the identifier of the
                                       project is known.

| `fields.issuetype.name`   | yes     | A name that identifies the type of the issue. Jira provides default

                                       be replaced by `issue.issuetype.id` if the identifier of the type
                                       is known.

| `fields.summary`          | yes     | The summary (or title) of the issue.

[[configuring-jira]]
==== Configuring Jira accounts

You configure the accounts {watcher} can use to communicate with Jira in the
`xpack.notification.jira` namespace in `elasticsearch.yml`.

{watcher} supports Basic Authentication for Jira Software. To configure a
Jira account you need to specify (see {ref}/secure-settings.html[secure settings]):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.notification.jira.account.monitoring.secure_url
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.notification.jira.account.monitoring.secure_user
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.notification.jira.account.monitoring.secure_password
--------------------------------------------------

[WARNING]
======
Storing sensitive data (`url`, `user` and `password`) in the configuration file or the cluster settings is insecure and has been deprecated. Please use {es}'s secure {ref}/secure-settings.html[keystore] method instead.
======

To avoid credentials that transit in clear text over the network, {watcher} will
reject `url` settings like `http://internal-jira.elastic.co` that are based on
plain text HTTP protocol. This default behavior can be disabled with the explicit
 `allow_http` setting:

NOTE: The `url` field can also contain a path, that is used to create an issue. By
default this is `/rest/api/2/issue`. If you set this as well, make sure that this
path is the full path to the endpoint to create an issue.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.notification.jira:
  account:
    monitoring:
      allow_http: true
--------------------------------------------------

WARNING: It is strongly advised to use Basic Authentication with secured HTTPS
 protocol only.

You can also specify defaults for the
<<jira-account-attributes,Jira issues>>:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.notification.jira:
  account:
    monitoring:
      issue_defaults:
        project:
          key: proj
        issuetype:
          name: Bug
        summary: "X-Pack Issue"
        labels: ["auto"]
--------------------------------------------------

If you configure multiple Jira accounts, you either need to configure a default
account or specify which account the notification should be sent with in the
<<actions-jira,`jira`>> action.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.notification.jira:
  default_account: team1
  account:
    team1:
      ...
    team2:
      ...
--------------------------------------------------

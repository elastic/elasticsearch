=== {watcher} never condition

<titleabbrev>Never condition</titleabbrev>

Use the `never` condition to skip performing the watch actions whenever the watch is triggered. The watch input is processed, a record is
added to the watch history, and watch execution ends. 
This condition is generally used for testing.

==== Using the never condition

There are no attributes to specify for the `never` condition. To use the it,
you specify the condition type and associate it with an empty object:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
"condition" : {
  "never" : {}
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

=== Ack Watch API

<<actions-ack-throttle, Acknowledging>> a watch enables you to manually throttle
execution of the watch actions. The action's _acknowledgement state_ is stored in
the `status.actions.<id>.ack.state` structure.

The current status of the watch and the state of its actions are returned as part
of the <<api-java-get-watch, Get Watch API>> response:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
GetWatchResponse getWatchResponse = watcherClient.prepareGetWatch("my-watch").get();
State state = getWatchResponse.getStatus().actionStatus("my-action").ackStatus().state();
--------------------------------------------------

The action state of a newly created watch is `awaits_successful_execution`. When
the watch runs and its condition is met, the state changes to `ackable`.
Acknowledging the action sets the state to `acked`.

When an action state is set to `acked`, further executions of that action are
throttled until its state is reset to `awaits_successful_execution`. This happens
when the watch condition is no longer met (the condition evaluates to `false`).

The following snippet shows how to acknowledge an action. You specify the IDs of
the watch and the action you want to acknowledge--in this example `my-watch` and
`my-action`:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
AckWatchResponse ackResponse = watcherClient.prepareAckWatch("my-watch").setActionIds("my-action").get();
--------------------------------------------------

As a response to this request, the status of the watch and the state of the
action are returned and can be obtained from `AckWatchResponse` object:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
WatchStatus status = ackResponse.getStatus();
ActionStatus actionStatus = status.actionStatus("my-action");
ActionStatus.AckStatus ackStatus = actionStatus.ackStatus();
ActionStatus.AckStatus.State ackState = ackStatus.state();
--------------------------------------------------

You can acknowledge multiple actions:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
AckWatchResponse ackResponse = watcherClient.prepareAckWatch("my-watch")
  .setActionIds("action1", "action2")
  .get();
--------------------------------------------------

To acknowledge all actions of a watch, specify only the watch ID:

[source,java]
--------------------------------------------------
AckWatchResponse ackResponse = watcherClient.prepareAckWatch("my-watch").get();
--------------------------------------------------

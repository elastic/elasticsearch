=== Watches are not updated when file based scripts change

When you refer to a file script in a watch, the watch itself is not updated
if you change the script on the filesystem.

Currently, the only way to reload a file script in a watch is to delete 
the watch and recreate it.

=== Security integration

When the {security-features} are enabled, a watch stores information about what
the user who stored the watch is allowed to execute **at that time**. This means,
if those permissions change over time, the watch will still be able to execute
with the permissions that existed when the watch was created.

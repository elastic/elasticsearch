      area: Cluster and node setting
      title: Make S3 custom query parameter optional
      details: "Earlier versions of Elasticsearch would record the purpose of each S3 API call using the `?x-purpose=` custom query parameter. This isn't believed to be necessary outside of the ECH/ECE/ECK/... managed services, and it adds rather a lot to the request logs, so with this change we make the feature optional and disabled by default."
      impact: "If you wish to reinstate the old behaviour on a S3 repository, set `s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.add_purpose_custom_query_parameter` to `true` for the relevant client."

      details: |-
        This endpoint is largely used for local searches only and is not compatible with true cross-cluster searches where
        arbitrary number of indices and remotes can be specified. Although it is meant to accept an index parameter that
        denotes a single searchable target, such a limitation can be bypassed through various means.

        Keeping in view this endpoint's stated intent and future scope, cross-cluster functionality is being explicitly disabled.
      impact: |-

      body: |-
        Time series aggregations in ES|QL can be optionally calculated over a sliding time window. Using a window
        larger than the time bucket interval reduces jitter in dashboards, by taking a larger number of data points into
        account.

        Windows can be specified in all supported time series aggregations, as a second argument. For instance, the
        following ES|QL query calculates the average rate of requests per host every minute, using a 10-minute window:

        TS metrics
        | WHERE TRANGE(1h)
        | STATS avg(rate(requests, 10m)) BY TBUCKET(1m), host

        Acceptable window values are currently limited to multiples of the time bucket value (e.g. `BUCKET` or `TBUCKET`),
        as specified in the BY-clause. If no window is provided, it's implicitly set to the time bucket value,
        matching existing behavior.

      title: New exponential_histogram field type for native OpenTelemetry exponential histogram support
      body: |-
        A new `exponential_histogram` field type has been added to Elasticsearch, providing native support for
        OpenTelemetry exponential histograms.

        Exponential histograms offer an efficient way to collect distributions (e.g. response times) at a high compression
        ratio while still maintaining good accuracy for percentile estimation. They can be easily collected via
        OpenTelemetry SDKs, as the only required configuration is the maximum allowed number of buckets. The actual buckets will be
        chosen automatically based on the observed values.

        The new `exponential_histogram` field type is supported in ES|QL.
        It can be aggregated using the `PERCENTILES`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` and `SUM` functions.

    issues: []

      notable: true
      title: New dense_vector options for storing bfloat16 vectors and utilising on-disk rescoring
      body: |-
        New options have been added to the `dense_vector` field type.

        The first is support for storing vectors in bfloat16 format.
        This is a floating-point format that utilises two bytes per value rather than four, halving the storage space
        required compared to `element_type: float`. This can be specified with `element_type: bfloat16`
        when creating the index, for all `dense_vector` indexing types.

        Float values are automatically rounded to two bytes when writing to disk, so this format can be used
        with original source vectors at two- or four-byte precision. BFloat16 values are zero-expanded back to four-byte floats
        when read into memory. Using `bfloat16` will cause a loss of precision compared to
        the original vector values, as well as a small performance hit due to converting between `bfloat16` and `float`
        when reading and writing vectors; however this may be counterbalanced by a corresponding decrease in I/O,
        depending on your workload.

        The second option is to enable on-disk rescoring. When rescoring vectors during kNN searches, the raw vectors
        are read into memory. When the vector data is larger than the amount of available RAM, this might cause the OS
        to evict some in-memory pages that then need to be paged back in immediately afterwards. This can cause
        a significant slowdown in search speed. Enabling on-disk rescoring causes rescoring to use raw vector data
        on-disk during rescoring, and to not read it into memory first. This can significantly increase search performance
        in such low-memory situations.

        Enable on-disk rescoring using the `on_disk_rescore: true` index option.

      title: Add compression for binary doc values
      body: |-
        Add compression for binary doc values using Zstd and blocks with a variable number of values.

        Block-wise LZ4 compression was previously added to Lucene in LUCENE-9211 and removed in LUCENE-9378 due to query performance issues.
        This approach stored a constant number of values per block (specifically 32 values).
        This made it easy to map a given value index (e.g., docId) to the block containing it by doing blockId = docId / 32.
        Unfortunately, if values are very large, we must still have exactly 32 values per block, and (de)compressing a block could cause very high memory usage.
        As a result, we had to keep the number of values small, meaning that in the average case, a block was much smaller than ideal.

        To overcome the issues of blocks with a constant number of values, this PR adds block-wise compression with a variable number of values per block.
        It stores a minimum of 1 document per block and stops adding values when the size of a block exceeds a threshold or the number of values exceeds a threshold.
        Like the previous version, it stores an array of addresses for the start of each block.
        Additionally, it stores a parallel array with the docId at the start of each block.
        When looking up a given docId, if it is not in the current block, we binary search the array of docId starts to find the blockId containing the value.
        We then look up the address of the block.
        After this, decompression works very similarly to the code from LUCENE-9211; the main difference being that Zstd(1) is used instead of LZ4.

        The introduction of binary doc value compression transparently affects wildcard field types, like URLs that are common in access logs, which will now compress much better.

      title: Enable large numeric blocks for TSDB codec
      body: |-
        The size of numeric blocks gets increased from 128 to 512, for indices with [index.mode:time-series].
        This mostly improves compression for multi-values in fields using sorted-set doc values, such as keyword and
        ip fields, as run-length encoding covers more data for the same storage footprint.

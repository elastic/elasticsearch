caused (including by the negligence of that party) suffered or incurred by the other party in connection with this
agreement. “Consequential Loss” means loss of revenues, loss of reputation, indirect loss, loss of profits,
consequential loss, loss of actual or anticipated savings, indirect loss, lost opportunities, including opportunities to

4.2    Damages Cap. SUBJECT TO CLAUSES 4.1 AND 4.3, ANY LIABILITY OF ELASTICSEARCH FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE, HOWEVER
CAUSED (INCLUDING BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ELASTICSEARCH), SUFFERED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO
THE AMOUNT YOU PAID, IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, UNDER THE

4.3    Limitation and Disclaimer Exceptions. If the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any other legislation or
any other legislation states that there is a guarantee in relation to any good or service supplied by Elasticsearch in
connection with this agreement, and Elasticsearch’s liability for failing to comply with that guarantee cannot be
excluded but may be limited, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 do not apply to that liability and instead Elasticsearch’s liability
for such failure is limited (at Elasticsearch’s election) to, in the case of a supply of goods, the Elasticsearch
replacing the goods or supplying equivalent goods or repairing the goods, or in the case of a supply of services,
Elasticsearch supplying the services again or paying the cost of having the services supplied again.

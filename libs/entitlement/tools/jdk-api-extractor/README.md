This tool scans the JDK on which it is running to extract its public accessible API.
That is:
- public methods (including constructors) of public, exported classes as well as protected methods of non-final classes.
- any overwrites of public methods of public, exported super classes and interfaces.

The output of this tool is meant to be diffed against the output for another JDK
version to identify changes that need to be reviewed for entitlements.
The output is compatible with the `public-callers-finder` tool to calculate the
public transitive surface of new additions. See the example below.

The following `TAB`-separated columns are written:
1. module name
2. unused / empty (for compatibility with `public-callers-finder`)
3. unused / empty (for compatibility with `public-callers-finder`)
4. fully qualified class name (ASM style, with `/` separators)
5. method name
6. method descriptor (ASM signature)
7. visibility (`PUBLIC` / `PROTECTED`)
8. `STATIC` modifier or empty
9. `FINAL` modifier or empty

Usage example:
```bash
./gradlew :libs:entitlement:tools:jdk-api-extractor:run -Druntime.java=24 --args="api-jdk24.tsv"
./gradlew :libs:entitlement:tools:jdk-api-extractor:run -Druntime.java=25 --args="api-jdk25.tsv"

# diff the public apis
diff -u libs/entitlement/tools/jdk-api-extractor/api-jdk24.tsv libs/entitlement/tools/jdk-api-extractor/api-jdk25.tsv > libs/entitlement/tools/jdk-api-extractor/api.diff

# extract additions in the new JDK, these require the most careful review
cat libs/entitlement/tools/jdk-api-extractor/api.diff | grep '^+[^+]' | sed 's/^+//' > api-jdk25-additions.tsv

# review new additions next for critical ones that should require entitlements
# once done, remove all lines that are not considered critical and run the public-callers-finder to report
# the transitive public surface for these additions
./gradlew :libs:entitlement:tools:public-callers-finder:run -Druntime.java=25 --args="api-jdk25-additions.tsv true"
```

### Optional arguments:

- `--deprecations-only`: reports public deprecations (by means of `@Deprecated`)
- `--include-incubator`: include incubator modules (e.g. `jdk.incubator.vector`)

```bash
./gradlew :libs:entitlement:tools:jdk-api-extractor:run -Druntime.java=24 --args="deprecations-jdk24.tsv --deprecations-only"
```

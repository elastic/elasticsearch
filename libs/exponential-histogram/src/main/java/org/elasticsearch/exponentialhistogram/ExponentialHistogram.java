/**
 * Interface for implementations of exponential histograms adhering to the
 * <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram">OpenTelemetry definition</a>.
 * This interface supports sparse implementations, allowing iteration over buckets without requiring direct index access.<br>
 * The most important properties are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The histogram has a scale parameter, which defines the accuracy. A higher scale implies a higher accuracy.
 *     The {@code base} for the buckets is defined as {@code base = 2^(2^-scale)}.</li>
 *     <li>The histogram bucket at index {@code i} has the range {@code (base^i, base^(i+1)]}</li>
 *     <li>Negative values are represented by a separate negative range of buckets with the boundaries {@code (-base^(i+1), -base^i]}</li>
 *     <li>Histograms are perfectly subsetting: increasing the scale by one merges each pair of neighboring buckets</li>
 *     <li>A special {@link ZeroBucket} is used to handle zero and close-to-zero values</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <br>
 * Additionally, all algorithms assume that samples within a bucket are located at a single point: the point of least relative error
 * (see {@link ExponentialScaleUtils#getPointOfLeastRelativeError(long, int)}).

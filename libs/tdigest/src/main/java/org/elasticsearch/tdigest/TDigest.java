 * Adaptive histogram based on something like streaming k-means crossed with Q-digest.

 * - works on doubles as well as integers.
 * - provides part per million accuracy for extreme quantiles and typically &lt;1000 ppm accuracy for middle quantiles
 * - fast
 * - simple
 * - test coverage roughly at 90%
 * - easy to adapt for use with map-reduce

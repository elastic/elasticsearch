     * This is overridden in order to keep empty arrays in nested exclusions - see #109668.

     * If we are excluding contents, we only want to exclude based on property name - but empty arrays in themselves do not have a property
     * name. If the empty array were to be excluded, it should be done by excluding the parent.
     * <p>
     * Note though that the expected behavior seems to be ambiguous if contentsFiltered is true - that is, that the filter has pruned all
     * the contents of a given array, such that we are left with the empty array. The behavior below drops that array, for at the time of
     * writing, not doing so would cause assertions in JsonXContentFilteringTests to fail, which expect this behavior. Yet it is not obvious
     * if dropping the empty array in this case is correct. For example, one could expect this sort of behavior:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Document: <pre>{ "myArray": [ { "myField": "myValue" } ]}</pre></li>
     *     <li>Filter: <pre>{ "exclude": "myArray.myField" }</pre></li>
     * </ul>
     * From the user's perspective, this could reasonably yield either of:
     * <ol>
     *     <li><pre>{ "myArray": []}</pre></li>
     *     <li>Removing {@code myArray} entirely.</li>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

					 The "Artistic License"

						Preamble

		The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
		Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
		semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
		while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
		the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
		reasonable modifications.

		Definitions:

			"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
			Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
			created through textual modification.

			"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
			modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
			of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

			"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
			copyrights for the package.

			"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
			this Package.

			"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
			basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
			and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
			Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
			as a market that must bear the fee.)

			"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
			itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
			It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
			under the same conditions they received it.

		1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
		duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

		2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
		derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
		modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

		3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
		that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
		when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
		following:

		    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
		    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
		    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
		    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
		    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

		    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

		    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
		    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
		    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
		    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

		    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

		4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
		executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

		    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
		    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
		    to get the Standard Version.

		    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
		    the Package with your modifications.

		    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
		    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
		    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

		    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

		5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
		Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
		Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
		you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
		commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
		distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
		product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
		an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
		form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
		interpreter is so embedded.

		6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
		output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
		under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
		them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
		Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
		Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
		binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
		neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
		fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
		not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
		Package.

		7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
		languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
		emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
		Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
		equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
		not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
		regression tests for the language.

		8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
		permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
		when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
		to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
		construed as a distribution of this Package.

		9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
		products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

		10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
		IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
		WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

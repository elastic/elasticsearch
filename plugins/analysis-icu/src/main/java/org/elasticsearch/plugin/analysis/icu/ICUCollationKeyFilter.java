/**
 * <p>
 *   Converts each token into its {@link com.ibm.icu.text.CollationKey}, and

 *   allow it to be stored as an index term.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   <strong>WARNING:</strong> Make sure you use exactly the same Collator at
 *   index and query time -- CollationKeys are only comparable when produced by
 *   the same Collator.  {@link com.ibm.icu.text.RuleBasedCollator}s are
 *   independently versioned, so it is safe to search against stored
 *   CollationKeys if the following are exactly the same (best practice is
 *   to store this information with the index and check that they remain the
 *   same at query time):
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     Collator version - see {@link Collator#getVersion()}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The collation strength used - see {@link Collator#setStrength(int)}
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 *   CollationKeys generated by ICU Collators are not compatible with those
 *   generated by java.text.Collators.  Specifically, if you use
 *   ICUCollationKeyFilter to generate index terms, do not use
 *   {@code CollationKeyFilter} on the query side, or vice versa.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   ICUCollationKeyFilter is significantly faster and generates significantly
 *   shorter keys than CollationKeyFilter.  See
 *   <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun"
 *   >http://site.icu-project.org/charts/collation-icu4j-sun</a> for key
 *   generation timing and key length comparisons between ICU4J and
 *   java.text.Collator over several languages.
 * </p>
 *  @deprecated Use {@link ICUCollationDocValuesField} instead, which encodes
 *  terms directly as bytes. This filter WAS removed in Lucene 5.0

/* This project runs the core REST tests against a 2 node cluster where one of the nodes has a different minor.
 * Since we don't have a version to test against we currently use the hardcoded snapshot for to bascially run
 * against ourself. To test that useing a different version works got into distribution/zip and execute:
 *   gradle clean install -Dbuild.snapshot=false
 *
 * This installs the release-build into a local .m2 repository, then change this version here to:
 *   bwcVersion = "5.0.0"
 *
 * now you can run the bwc tests with:
 *   gradle check -Drepos.mavenlocal=true
 *
 * (-Drepos.mavenlocal=true will force gradle to look for the zip distribuiton in the local .m2 repository)

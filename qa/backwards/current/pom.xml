    <description>Backwards compatibility tests against the current version</description>
    <!-- This runs the backwards compatibility tests against the version of
        elasticsearch being built. This certainly should pass but we run it
        anyway for two reasons:
        1. To smoke test the backwards compatibility tests. If they don't pass
        here then you know there is something wrong with them or the current
        version.
        2. To keep the backwards compatibility tests alive when there isn't a
        released version that much be backwards compatible. When 2.0.0 was under
        development the backwards compatibility tests atrophied because there
        wasn't a version to run them against. That should not happen with 5.0.0!

[NOTE]
.Required settings
=======================================
Certain tests require specific settings to be applied to the
Elasticsearch instance in order to pass. You should run
Elasticsearch as follows:

[source,sh]
---------------------
bin/elasticsearch -Enode.attr.testattr=test -Epath.repo=/tmp -Erepositories.url.allowed_urls='http://snapshot.*'
---------------------

=======================================

== Test execution

Please refer to xref:/TESTING.asciidoc#testing-the-rest-layer[this section].

== Test file structure

A YAML test file consists of:

- an optional `setup` section, followed by
- an optional `teardown` section, followed by
- one or more test sections

For instance:

    setup:
      - do: ....
      - do: ....

    ---
    teardown:
      - do: ....

    ---
    "First test":
      - do: ...
      - match: ...

    ---
    "Second test":
      - do: ...
      - match: ...


A `setup` section contains a list of commands to run before each test
section in order to setup the same environment for each test section.

A `teardown` section contains a list of commands to run after each test
section in order to setup the same environment for each test section. This
may be needed for modifications made by the test that are not cleared by the
deletion of indices and templates.

A test section represents an independent test, containing multiple `do`
statements and assertions. The contents of a test section must be run in
order, but individual test sections may be run in any order, as follows:

1. run `setup` (if any)
2. reset the `response` var and the `stash` (see below)
2. run test contents
3. run `teardown` (if any)
4. delete all indices and all templates

== Dot notation:

Dot notation is used for (1) method calls and (2) hierarchical data structures. For
instance, a method call like `cluster.health` would do the equivalent of:

    client.cluster.health(...params...)

A test against `_tokens.1.token` would examine the `token` key, in the second element
of the `tokens` array, inside the `response` var (see below):

    $val = $response->{tokens}[1]{token}  # Perl syntax roolz!

If one of the levels (eg `tokens`) does not exist, it should return an undefined value.
If no field name is given (ie the empty string) then return the current
$val -- used for testing the whole response body.

Use \. to specify paths that actually contain '.' in the key name, for example
in the `indices.get_settings` API.

== Skipping tests:

If a test section should only be run for certain releases of Elasticsearch,
then the first entry in the section (after the title) should be called
`requires` and / or `skip` depending on the use case.

A `requires` section defines requirements that have to be met in order for tests to run, such as:

- `capabilities` to <<capabilities_check, require API capabilities>>.
- `cluster_features` to <<cluster_features, require cluster features>>.
- `test_runner_features` to <<requires_test_runner_features, require test runner features>>.

A `skip` section, on the other hand, defines certain conditions that, if met, will skip the test, such as:

- `capabilities` to <<capabilities_check, skip if API capabilities are present>>.
- `cluster_features` to <<cluster_features, skip if cluster features are present>>.
- `known_issues` to <<skip_known_issues, skip on known issues (based on cluster features)>>.
- `awaits_fix` to <<skip_awaits_fix, always skip / mute a test due to a pending fix>>.
- `os` to <<skip_os, skip on operating systems>>.
- `features`: Only kept for a transition period, please use <<requires_test_runner_features, `test_runner_features`>>
  in the `requires` section instead.

Note that `skip` with `capabilities` or `cluster_features` will skip the test if *any* node in the cluster
has the feature or capability. `requires` will only run the test if *all* of the nodes in the cluster
have the feature or capability.

`requires` and `skip` sections must specify at least one of the options mentioned above.
Unless only `test_runner_features` or legacy test runner `features` are specified, a `reason` must be given.

`requires` and `skip` can also be used at the top level of the file in the `setup` and `teardown` blocks,
so all the tests in a file will be skipped if either any requirement fails or any skip condition applies regardless
if defined in `setup` and `teardown`.

[[capabilities_check]]
=== Require or skip API capabilities

As opposed to <<cluster_features,cluster features>>, which are aimed at performing checks internal to Elasticsearch,
the capabilities API allows external clients to ask an Elasticsearch cluster what it supports in terms of
particular endpoints, query parameters and other arbitrary capabilities.

Only if every node in the cluster supports the requested path and method with all parameters and capabilities,
the capabilities check passes successfully. Capabilities checks can be done both for `skip` and `requires`
prerequisites. In either case, the _capabilities_ test runner feature must be required to allow
other test runners to skip tests if they do not support the capabilities API yet.

....
    "Parent":
     - requires:
          capabilities:
            - method: GET
              path: /_api
              parameters: [param1, param2]
              capabilities: [cap1, cap2]
          test_runner_features: [capabilities]
          reason: Capability required to run test
     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

The `capabilities` field is an array containing one or several capabilities checks.

Capabilities are declared as part of an implementation of `RestHandler`.
Override the `supportedQueryParameters` and/or the `supportedCapabilities` methods:

....
@Override
public Set<String> supportedQueryParameters() {
  return Set.of("param1", "param2");
}

@Override
public Set<String> supportedCapabilities() {
  return Set.of("cap1", "cap2");
}
....

[[cluster_features]]
=== Require or skip cluster features

Cluster features indicate a particular high-level _internal_ functionality and are used for coordination within
the Elasticsearch cluster to enable functionality once supported on all nodes, e.g. usage of a new transport endpoint.

In contrast to <<capabilities_check, capabilities>>, cluster features are strictly internal, though can also be used for
skipping REST tests. Cluster features are not meant to be extremely fine-grained. In case you are not sure if you need
a cluster feature, <<capabilities_check, capabilities>> might be the better choice.

To select applicable tests (e.g. in backwards compatibility or mixed cluster tests), you can require `cluster_features`
to be either present (`requires`) or absent (`skip`), for instance:

....
    "Parent":
     - requires:
          cluster_features: feature_x
          reason:           Feature X was introduced
     - skip:
          cluster_features: feature_x_changed
          reason:           Change to feature X breaks this test

     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

The `cluster_features` field can either be a string or an array of strings.

[[synthetic_cluster_features]]
Note: In order to smoothen the transition from version checks to cluster feature checks, a REST-test specific
synthetic cluster feature named `gte_v{VERSION}` is available for all release versions up to 8.15.0.
For instance, `gte_v8.12.2` would be available for all release versions greater than or equal to 8.12.2.

[[skip_known_issues]]
=== Skip on known issues

Previously, it was possible to skip ranges of broken release versions using `version`.
`known_issues` provides a more explicit way to express and skip a certain range of buggy releases based on cluster features.
Each of possibly multiple issues is a pair of `cluster_feature` and `fixed_by`, where an issue was
introduced by the former feature and eventually fixed by the latter one. For instance:

....
    "Parent":
     - skip:
          known_issues:
            - cluster_feature: feature_y
              fixed_by:        feature_y_fix
            - cluster_feature: feature_z
              fixed_by:        feature_z_fix
          reason: Skipped for buggy feature_y until fixed by feature_y_fix and feature_z until fixed by feature_z_fix

     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

The `known_issues` field is an array containing one or several issues.

Note: If a known issue cannot be defined in terms of existing cluster features, the previously described
<<synthetic_cluster_features,synthetic version based cluster features>> can be used.

[[skip_awaits_fix]]
=== Skip while awaiting fix

In certain cases there's no fix available yet. In order to mute a test, use `awaits_fix` with the corresponding ticket / issue.

For instance:
....
    "Parent":
     - skip:
          awaits_fix: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/xyz
          reason:     Muted due to #xyz

     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

[[skip_os]]
=== Skip on certain operating systems

The `skip` section can also be used to mute tests for certain operating systems.
This way it is not necessary to mute the whole test if an operating system
specific problem appears.

The operating system is taken from the pretty name that elasticsearch reports
using the `GET /_nodes` API. To obtain the name from a CI build grep the logs
for:

`initializing client, minimum es version`

When muting by operating system, a `reason` is mandatory and `skip_os` must be defined as requirement in
`test_runner_features` (see below).

....
    "Parent":
     - requires:
          test_runner_features: skip_os
     - skip:
          os:       debian-8
          reason:   memory accounting problems on debian 8, see gh#xyz

     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

The `os` field can either be a string or an array of strings.

[[requires_test_runner_features]]
=== Require specific test runner features

The `requires` section can also be used to list test runner features that need to be
supported by the runner in order to execute a test. This way the up-to-date runners will
run the test, while the ones that don't support the feature yet can
temporarily skip it, and avoid having lots of test failures in the meantime.
Once all runners have implemented the feature, it can be declared supported
by default, thus the related `requires` sections can be removed from the tests.

The `requires` section can also be used to selectively mute tests in certain
cases where they would otherwise fail, see `default_shards` and `fips_140`.

....
    "Parent":
     - requires:
          test_runner_features:    regex

     - do:
       ... test definitions ...
....

The `test_runner_features` field can either be a string or an array of strings.

Note:
Tests that are still using `features` in the `skip` sections should be migrated to
`test_runner_features` to avoid confusion with recently added cluster features.

==== Available test runner features

===== `capabilities`
The runner supports checks against the <<capabilities_check,capabilities API>> in a `skip` or `requires`
prerequisite section.

===== `xpack`
Requires x-pack to be enabled on the `Elasticsearch` instance the rest test is running against

===== `no_xpack`
Requires the test to run against an oss distribution of `Elasticsearch`

===== `catch_unauthorized`

Runner supports `catch: unauthorized` on a `do` operator.

===== `default_shards`

This test can only run if the cluster is running with the distributions default number of shards.

The Java test runner introduces randomness and sometimes overrides the default number of shards to `2`.
If the default number of shards is changed, test marked with this feature should *not* run

===== `headers`

The runner is able to set per request headers on the `do` operation

===== `node_selector`

Indicates the runner can parse `node_selector` under the `do` operator and use its metadata to select the node to
perform the `do` operation on.

===== `stash_in_key`

Allows you to use a stashed value in any key of an object during a `match` assertion

....
- set: {nodes.$master.http.publish_address: host}
- match:
    $body:
      {
        "nodes": {
          $host: {
            ... stuff in here ...
          }
        }
     }
....

===== `stash_in_path`

Allows a stashed value to be referenced in path lookups as a single token. E.g:

....
path.$stash.value
....

===== `embedded_stash_key`

Allows a stashed key to appear anywhere in the path (note the placeholder needs to be within curly brackets too in this case):

....
field1.e${placeholder}ments.element1
....

===== `stash_path_replace`
Used only in the doc snippet tests. Allow you to do ease replacements using a special `$_path` marker.

....
// TESTRESPONSEs/somevalue/$body.${_path}/ to mean "replace
somevalue with whatever is the response in the same position."
....

===== `warnings`

The runner can assert specific warnings headers are returned by Elasticsearch through the `warning:` assertations
under `do:`  operations. The test will fail if the warning is not found.

===== `warnings_regex`

The same as `warnings`, but matches warning headers with the given regular expression.


===== `allowed_warnings`

The runner will allow specific warnings headers to be returned by Elasticsearch through the `allowed_warning:` assertations
under `do:`  operations. The test will not fail if the warning is not found.

===== `allowed_warnings_regex`

The same as `allowed_warnings`, but matches warning headers with the given regular expression.

===== `yaml`

The runner is able to send and receive `application/yaml` and perform all assertions on the returned data.

===== `contains`

Asserts an array of object contains an object with a property set to a certain value. e.g:

...
contains:  { nodes.$master.plugins: { name: painless-whitelist } }
...

Asserts the plugins array contains an object with a `name` property with the value `painless-whitelist`

Alternatively, this can be used to assert that a string response contains a certain substring:

...
contains: { items.0.index.error.reason: "must be mapped" }

===== `transform_and_set`

Supports the `transform_and_set` operator as described in this document.

===== `arbitrary_key`

Allows you to stash an arbitrary key from a returned map e.g:

....
- set:
    nodes._arbitrary_key_: node_id
....

This means: Stash any of the keys returned under `nodes` as `$node_id`

===== `fips_140`

This test should not be run when the test cluster is set in FIPS 140 mode.

== Required operators:

=== `do`

The `do` operator calls a method on the client. For instance:

....
    - do:
        cluster.health:
            level: shards
....

The response from the `do` operator should be stored in the `response` var, which
is reset (1) at the beginning of a file or (2) on the next `do`.

If the arguments to `do` include `catch`, then we are expecting an error, which should
be caught and tested. For instance:

....
    - do:
        catch:        missing
        get:
            index:    test
            type:     test
            id:        1

# And, optionally, you can assert on the contents of the precise contents of the error message:

    - match: { error.type: "illegal_argument_exception" }
    - match: { error.reason: "The request contained an illegal argument" }
    - match: { error.caused_by.reason: "The argument was illegal because ..." }
    - match: { error.root_cause.0.type: "illegal_argument_exception" }
....

The argument to `catch` can be any of:

[horizontal]
`bad_request`::     a 400 response from ES
`unauthorized`::    a 401 response from ES
`forbidden`::       a 403 response from ES
`missing`::         a 404 response from ES
`request_timeout`:: a 408 response from ES
`conflict`::        a 409 response from ES
`request`::         a 4xx-5xx error response from ES, not equal to any named response
                    above
`unavailable`::     a 503 response from ES
`param`::           a client-side error indicating an unknown parameter has been passed
                    to the method
`/foo bar/`::       the text of the error message matches this regular expression

If `catch` is specified, then the `response` var must be cleared, and the test
should fail if no error is thrown.

If the arguments to `do` include `warnings` then we are expecting a `Warning`
header to come back from the request. If the arguments *don't* include a
`warnings` argument then we *don't* expect the response to include a `Warning`
header. The warnings must match exactly. Using it looks like this:

....
    - do:
        warnings:
            - '[index] is deprecated'
            - quotes are not required because yaml
            - but this argument is always a list, never a single string
            - no matter how many warnings you expect
        get:
            index:    test
            type:    test
            id:        1
....

If the arguments to `do` include `allowed_warnings` then matching `Warning`
headers do not fail the request. Unlike the `warnings` argument, these aren't
expected so much as "allowed". This usually comes up in backwards compatibility
testing. Using it looks like this:

....
    - do:
        allowed_warnings:
            - some warning
            - this argument is also always a list, never a single string
            - no matter how many warnings you expect
        get:
            index:    test
            type:    test
            id:        1
....

If the arguments to `do` include `node_selector` then the request is only
sent to nodes that match the `node_selector`. It looks like this:

....
"test id":
 - skip:
      features: node_selector
 - do:
      node_selector:
          version: " - 6.9.99"
      index:
          index:  test-weird-index-中文
          type:   weird.type
          id:     1
          body:   { foo: bar }
....

If you list multiple selectors then the request will only go to nodes that
match all of those selectors. The following selectors are supported:

- `version`: Only nodes who's version is within the range will receive the
request. The syntax for the pattern is the same as when `version` is within
`skip` but also supports `current` which selects nodes of the current version.
`current` is useful when running mixed version tests if the results vary based
on the version of the node that received the request.
- `attribute`: Only nodes that have an attribute matching the name and value
of the provided attribute match.
Looks like:
....
      node_selector:
          attribute:
              name: value
....

=== `set`

For some tests, it is necessary to extract a value from the previous `response`, in
order to reuse it in a subsequent `do` and other tests. For instance, when
testing indexing a document without a specified ID:

....
    - do:
        index:
            index: test
            type:  test
    - set:  { _id: id }   # stash the value of `response._id` as `id`
    - do:
        get:
            index: test
            type:  test
            id:    $id    # replace `$id` with the stashed value
    - match: { _id: $id } # the returned `response._id` matches the stashed `id`
....

The last response obtained gets always stashed automatically as a string, called `body`.
This is useful when needing to test apis that return text rather than json (e.g. cat api),
as it allows to treat the whole body as an ordinary string field.

Stashed values can be used in property names, eg:

....
  - do:
      cluster.state: {}

  - set: {master_node: master}

  - do:
      nodes.info:
        metric: [ transport ]

  - is_true: nodes.$master.transport.profiles
....


Note that not only expected values can be retrieved from the stashed values (as in the
example above), but the same goes for actual values:

....
    - match: { $body: /^.+$/ } # the returned `body` matches the provided regex if the body is text
    - match: { $body: {} } # the returned `body` matches the JSON object if the body is JSON
....

The stash should be reset at the beginning of each test file.

=== `transform_and_set`

For some tests, it is necessary to extract a value and transform it from the previous `response`, in
order to reuse it in a subsequent `do` and other tests.
Currently, it only has support for `base64EncodeCredentials`, for unknown transformations it will not
do anything and stash the value as is.
For instance, when testing you may want to base64 encode username and password for
`Basic` authorization header:

....
    - do:
        index:
            index: test
            type:  test
    - transform_and_set:  { login_creds: "#base64EncodeCredentials(user,password)" }   # stash the base64 encoded credentials of `response.user` and `response.password` as `login_creds`
    - do:
        headers:
            Authorization: Basic ${login_creds} # replace `$login_creds` with the stashed value
        get:
            index: test
            type:  test
....

Stashed values can be used as described in the `set` section

=== `is_after`

Used to compare two variables (both need to be of type String, which can be parsed to an Instant) and check, whether
the first one is after the other one.

....
    - is_after: { result.some_field: 2023-05-25T12:30:00.000Z }
....

=== `is_true`

The specified key exists and has a true value (ie not `0`, `false`, `undefined`, `null`
or the empty string), eg:

....
    - is_true:  fields.foo  # the foo key exists in the fields hash and is "true"
....

=== `is_false`

The specified key doesn't exist or has a false value (ie `0`, `false`, `undefined`,
`null` or the empty string), eg:

....
    - is_false:  fields._source  # the _source key doesn't exist in the fields hash or is "false"
....

=== `match`

Used to compare two variables (could be scalars, arrays or hashes). The two variables
should be identical, eg:

....
    - match: { _source: { foo: bar }}
....

Supports also regular expressions with flag X for more readability (accepts whitespaces and comments):

....
  - match:
      $body: >
               /^  epoch  \s+  timestamp          \s+  count  \s+  \n
                   \d+    \s+  \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}  \s+  \d+    \s+  \n  $/
....

**Note:** `$body` is used to refer to the last obtained response body as a string, while `''` refers to the parsed representation (parsed into a Map by the Java runner for instance). Having the raw string response is for example useful when testing cat APIs.

=== `close_to`

Used to compare floats or doubles with a specified error bound.

....
    - close_to { path.to.actual.value, {value: 0.12345678, error: 0.00000001}}
....

**Note: you should use a feature skip along with close_to, as not all runners
support it:**

....
    - skip:
          features: close_to
....

=== `lt` and `gt`

Compares two numeric values, eg:

....
    - lt: { foo: 10000 }  # the `foo` value is less than 10,000
....

=== `lte` and `gte`

Compares two numeric values, eg:

....
    - lte: { foo: 10000 }  # the `foo` value is less than or equal to 10,000
....

=== `length`

This depends on the data type of the value being examined, eg:

....
    - length: { _id: 22    }   # the `_id` string is 22 chars long
    - length: { _tokens: 3 }   # the `_tokens` array has 3 elements
    - length: { _source: 5 }   # the `_source` hash has 5 keys
....

=== `exists`

Checks if specified path exists with any value (empty string/list/object is permitted).

....
    - exists:  fields._source  # checks if the fields._source exist
....

/**
 * A mechanism to trigger an action on the completion of some (dynamic) collection of other actions. Basic usage is as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * try (var refs = new RefCountingRunnable(finalRunnable)) {
 *     for (var item : collection) {
 *         runAsyncAction(item, refs.acquire()); // releases the acquired ref on completion
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The delegate action is completed when execution leaves the try-with-resources block and every acquired reference is released. Unlike a
 * {@link CountDown} there is no need to declare the number of subsidiary actions up front (refs can be acquired dynamically as needed) nor
 * does the caller need to check for completion each time a reference is released. Moreover even outside the try-with-resources block you
 * can continue to acquire additional references, even in a separate thread, as long as there's at least one reference outstanding:
 *
 * <pre>
 * try (var refs = new RefCountingRunnable(finalRunnable)) {
 *     for (var item : collection) {
 *         if (condition(item)) {
 *             runAsyncAction(item, refs.acquire());
 *         }
 *     }
 *     if (flag) {
 *         runOneOffAsyncAction(refs.acquire());
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     for (var item : otherCollection) {
 *         var itemRef = refs.acquire(); // delays completion while the background action is pending
 *         executorService.execute(() -> {
 *             try (var ignored = itemRef) {
 *                 if (condition(item)) {
 *                     runOtherAsyncAction(item, refs.acquire());
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * In particular (and also unlike a {@link CountDown}) this works even if you don't acquire any extra refs at all: in that case, the
 * delegate action executes at the end of the try-with-resources block.

/**
 * An {@link ActionListener} to which other {@link ActionListener} instances can subscribe, such that when this listener is completed it
 * fans-out its result to the subscribed listeners.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions are passed to subscribed listeners without modification. {@link ListenableActionFuture} and {@link ListenableFuture} are child
 * classes that provide additional exception handling.
 * <p>
 * A sequence of async steps can be chained together using a series of {@link SubscribableListener}s, similar to {@link CompletionStage}
 * (without the {@code catch (Throwable t)}). Listeners can be created for each step, where the next step subscribes to the result of the
 * previous, using utilities like {@link #andThen(CheckedBiConsumer)}. The following example demonstrates how this might be used:
 * <pre>{@code
 * private void exampleAsyncMethod(String request, List<Long> items, ActionListener<Boolean> finalListener) {
 *     SubscribableListener
 *
 *         // Start the chain and run the first step by creating a SubscribableListener using newForked():
 *         .<String>newForked(l -> firstAsyncStep(request, l))
 *
 *         // Run a second step when the first step completes using andThen(); if the first step fails then the exception falls through to
 *         // the end without executing the intervening steps.
 *         .<Integer>andThen((l, firstStepResult) -> secondAsyncStep(request, firstStepResult, l))
 *
 *         // Run another step when the second step completes with another andThen() call; as above this only runs if the first two steps
 *         // succeed.
 *         .<Boolean>andThen((l, secondStepResult) -> {
 *             if (condition) {
 *                 // Steps are exception-safe: an exception thrown here will be passed to the listener rather than escaping to the
 *                 // caller.
 *                 throw new IOException("failure");
 *             }
 *
 *             // Steps can fan out to multiple subsidiary async actions using utilities like RefCountingListener.
 *             final var result = new AtomicBoolean();
 *             try (var listeners = new RefCountingListener(l.map(v -> result.get()))) {
 *                 for (final var item : items) {
 *                     thirdAsyncStep(secondStepResult, item, listeners.acquire());
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         })
 *
 *         // Synchronous (non-forking) steps which do not return a result can be expressed using andThenAccept() with a consumer:
 *         .andThenAccept(thirdStepResult -> {
 *             if (condition) {
 *                 // andThenAccept() is also exception-safe
 *                 throw new ElasticsearchException("some other problem");
 *             }
 *             consumeThirdStepResult(thirdStepResult);
 *         })
 *
 *         // Synchronous (non-forking) steps which do return a result can be expressed using andThenApply() with a function:
 *         .andThenApply(voidFromStep4 -> {
 *             if (condition) {
 *                 // andThenApply() is also exception-safe
 *                 throw new IllegalArgumentException("failure");
 *             }
 *             return computeFifthStepResult();
 *         })
 *
 *         // To complete the chain, add the outer listener which will be completed with the result of the previous step if all steps were
 *         // successful, or the exception if any step failed.

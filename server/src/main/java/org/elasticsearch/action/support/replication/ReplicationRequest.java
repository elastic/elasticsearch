    /**
     * The reshardSplitShardCountSummary has been added to accommodate the Resharding feature.
     * This is populated when the coordinator is deciding which shards a request applies to.
     * For example, {@link org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.BulkOperation} splits
     * an incoming bulk request into shard level {@link org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.BulkShardRequest}
     * based on its cluster state view of the number of shards that are ready for indexing.
     * The purpose of this metadata is to reconcile the cluster state visible at the coordinating
     * node with that visible at the source shard node. (w.r.t resharding).
     * When an index is being split, there is a point in time when the newly created shard (target shard)
     * takes over its portion of the document space from the original shard (source shard).
     * Although the handoff is atomic at the original (source shard) and new shards (target shard),
     * there is a window of time between the coordinating node creating a shard request and the shard receiving and processing it.
     * This field is used by the original shard (source shard) when it processes the request to detect whether
     * the coordinator's view of the new shard's state when it created the request matches the shard's current state,
     * or whether the request must be reprocessed taking into account the current shard states.
     *
     * Note that we are able to get away with a single number, instead of an array of target shard states,
     * because we only allow splits in increments of 2x.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Suppose we are resharding an index from 2 -> 4 shards. While splitting a bulk request, the coordinator observes
     * that target shards are not ready for indexing. So requests that are meant for shard 0 and 2 are bundled together,
     * sent to shard 0 with “reshardSplitShardCountSummary” 2 in the request.
     * Requests that are meant for shard 1 and 3 are bundled together,
     * sent to shard 1 with “reshardSplitShardCountSummary” 2 in the request.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Suppose we are resharding an index from 4 -> 8 shards. While splitting a bulk request, the coordinator observes
     * that source shard 0 has completed HANDOFF but source shards 1, 2, 3 have not completed handoff.
     * So, the shard-bulk-request it sends to shard 0 and 4 has the "reshardSplitShardCountSummary" 8,
     * while the shard-bulk-request it sends to shard 1,2,3 has the "reshardSplitShardCountSummary" 4.
     * Note that in this case no shard-bulk-request is sent to shards 5, 6, 7 and the requests that were meant for these target shards
     * are bundled together with and sent to their source shards.
     *
     * A value of 0 indicates an INVALID reshardSplitShardCountSummary. Hence, a request with INVALID reshardSplitShardCountSummary
     * will be treated as a Summary mismatch on the source shard node.

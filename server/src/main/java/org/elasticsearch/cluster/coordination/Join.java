/**
 * Triggered by a {@link StartJoinRequest}, instances of this class represent join votes,
 * and have a voting and master-candidate node. The voting node is the node that provides
 * the vote, and the master-candidate node is the node for which this vote is cast. A join
 * vote is cast to reform the cluster around a particular master-eligible node, to elect
 * that node as the new master in a new term.
 *
 * A voting node will only cast a single vote per term. The vote includes information about
 * the current state of the node casting the vote, so that the candidate for the vote can
 * determine whether it has a more up-to-date state than the voting node.
 *
 * @param votingNode The node casting a vote for a master candidate.
 * @param masterCandidateNode The master candidate node receiving the vote for election.
 * @param term
 * @param lastAcceptedTerm
 * @param lastAcceptedVersion

/**
 * Collects configuration information (primarily <i>bindings</i>) which will be
 * used to create an {@link Injector}. Guice provides this object to your
 * application's {@link Module} implementors so they may each contribute
 * their own bindings and other registrations.
 * <h2>The Guice Binding EDSL</h2>
 * <p>
 * Guice uses an <i>embedded domain-specific language</i>, or EDSL, to help you
 * create bindings simply and readably.  This approach is great for overall
 * usability, but it does come with a small cost: <b>it is difficult to
 * learn how to use the Binding EDSL by reading
 * method-level javadocs</b>.  Instead, you should consult the series of
 * examples below.  To save space, these examples omit the opening
 * {@code binder}, just as you will if your module extends
 * {@link AbstractModule}.
 * <pre>
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 *
 * This statement does essentially nothing; it "binds the {@code ServiceImpl}
 * class to itself" and does not change Guice's default behavior.  You may still
 * want to use this if you prefer your {@link Module} class to serve as an
 * explicit <i>manifest</i> for the services it provides.  Also, in rare cases,
 * Guice may be unable to validate a binding at injector creation time unless it
 * is given explicitly.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 *
 * Specifies that a request for a {@code Service} instance with no binding
 * annotations should be treated as if it were a request for a
 * {@code ServiceImpl} instance.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).toProvider(ServiceProvider.class);</pre>
 *
 * In this example, {@code ServiceProvider} must extend or implement
 * {@code Provider<Service>}. This binding specifies that Guice should resolve
 * an unannotated injection request for {@code Service} by first resolving an
 * instance of {@code ServiceProvider} in the regular way, then calling
 * {@link Provider#get get()} on the resulting Provider instance to obtain the
 * {@code Service} instance.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Provider} you use here does not have to be a "factory"; that
 * is, a provider which always <i>creates</i> each instance it provides.
 * However, this is generally a good practice to follow.  You can then use
 * Guice's concept of {@link Scope scopes} to guide when creation should happen
 * -- "letting Guice work for you".
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(Red.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);</pre>
 *
 * Like the previous example, but only applies to injection requests that use
 * the binding annotation {@code @Red}.  If your module also includes bindings
 * for particular <i>values</i> of the {@code @Red} annotation (see below),
 * then this binding will serve as a "catch-all" for any values of {@code @Red}
 * that have no exact match in the bindings.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Singleton.class);
 *     // or, alternatively
 *     bind(ServiceImpl.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON);</pre>
 *
 * Either of these statements places the {@code ServiceImpl} class into
 * singleton scope.  Guice will create only one instance of {@code ServiceImpl}
 * and will reuse it for all injection requests of this type.  Note that it is
 * still possible to bind another instance of {@code ServiceImpl} if the second
 * binding is qualified by an annotation as in the previous example.  Guice is
 * not overly concerned with <i>preventing</i> you from creating multiple
 * instances of your "singletons", only with <i>enabling</i> your application to
 * share only one instance if that's all you tell Guice you need.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> a scope specified in this way <i>overrides</i> any scope that
 * was specified with an annotation on the {@code ServiceImpl} class.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(new TypeLiteral&lt;PaymentService&lt;CreditCard&gt;&gt;() {})
 *         .to(CreditCardPaymentService.class);</pre>
 *
 * This admittedly odd construct is the way to bind a parameterized type. It
 * tells Guice how to honor an injection request for an element of type
 * {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>}. The class
 * {@code CreditCardPaymentService} must implement the
 * {@code PaymentService<CreditCard>} interface.  Guice cannot currently bind or
 * inject a generic type, such as {@code Set<E>}; all type parameters must be
 * fully specified.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).toInstance(new ServiceImpl());
 *     // or, alternatively
 *     bind(Service.class).toInstance(SomeLegacyRegistry.getService());</pre>
 *
 * In this example, your module itself, <i>not Guice</i>, takes responsibility
 * for obtaining a {@code ServiceImpl} instance, then asks Guice to always use
 * this single instance to fulfill all {@code Service} injection requests.  When
 * the {@link Injector} is created, it will automatically perform field
 * and method injection for this instance, but any injectable constructor on
 * {@code ServiceImpl} is simply ignored.  Note that using this approach results
 * in "eager loading" behavior that you can't control.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bindConstant().annotatedWith(ServerHost.class).to(args[0]);</pre>
 *
 * Sets up a constant binding. Constant injections must always be annotated.
 * When a constant binding's value is a string, it is eligible for conversion to
 * all primitive types, to {@link Enum#valueOf all enums}, and to
 * {@link Class#forName class literals}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}Color("red") Color red; // A member variable (field)
 *    . . .
 *     red = MyModule.class.getDeclaredField("red").getAnnotation(Color.class);
 *     bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(red).to(RedService.class);</pre>
 *
 * If your binding annotation has parameters you can apply different bindings to
 * different specific values of your annotation.  Getting your hands on the
 * right instance of the annotation is a bit of a pain -- one approach, shown
 * above, is to apply a prototype annotation to a field in your module class, so
 * that you can read this annotation instance and give it to Guice.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class)
 *         .annotatedWith(Names.named("blue"))
 *         .to(BlueService.class);</pre>
 *
 * Differentiating by names is a common enough use case that we provided a
 * standard annotation, {@link org.elasticsearch.common.inject.name.Named @Named}.  Because of
 * Guice's library support, binding by name is quite easier than in the
 * arbitrary binding annotation case we just saw.  However, remember that these
 * names will live in a single flat namespace with all the other names used in
 * your application.
 *
 * <p>The above list of examples is far from exhaustive.  If you can think of
 * how the concepts of one example might coexist with the concepts from another,
 * you can most likely weave the two together.  If the two concepts make no
 * sense with each other, you most likely won't be able to do it.  In a few
 * cases Guice will let something bogus slip by, and will then inform you of
 * the problems at runtime, as soon as you try to create your Injector.
 *
 * <p>The other methods of Binder such as {@link #install}, and {@link #addError} are not part of the Binding EDSL;
 * you can learn how to use these in the usual way, from the method
 * documentation.

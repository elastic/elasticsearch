/**
 * A mapping from a key (type and optional annotation) to the strategy for getting instances of the
 * type. This interface is part of the introspection API and is intended primarily for use by
 * tools.
 * <p>
 * Bindings are created in several ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Explicitly in a module, via {@code bind()} and {@code bindConstant()}
 * statements:
 * <pre>
 *     bind(Service.class).annotatedWith(Red.class).to(ServiceImpl.class);
 *     bindConstant().annotatedWith(ServerHost.class).to(args[0]);</pre></li>
 * <li>Implicitly by the Injector by using its {@link Inject annotated} or default constructor.</li>
 * <li>By converting a bound instance to a different type.</li>
 * <li>For {@link Provider providers}, by delegating to the binding for the provided type.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <p>They exist on both modules and on injectors, and their behaviour is different for each:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Module bindings</strong> are incomplete and cannot be used to provide instances.
 * This is because the applicable scopes and interceptors may not be known until an injector
 * is created. From a tool's perspective, module bindings are like the injector's source
 * code. They can be inspected or rewritten, but this analysis must be done statically.</li>
 * <li><strong>Injector bindings</strong> are complete and valid and can be used to provide
 * instances. From a tools' perspective, injector bindings are like reflection for an
 * injector. They have full runtime information, including the complete graph of injections
 * necessary to satisfy a binding.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the bound type. The injected is always assignable to this type.

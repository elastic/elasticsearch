 * Annotates members of your implementation class (constructors, methods

 * The Injector fulfills injection requests for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Every instance it constructs. The class being constructed must have
 * exactly one of its constructors marked with {@code @Inject} or must have a
 * constructor taking no parameters. The Injector then proceeds to perform
 * method and field injections.
 * <li>Pre-constructed instances passed to
 * {@link org.elasticsearch.common.inject.binder.LinkedBindingBuilder#toInstance(Object)} and
 * {@link org.elasticsearch.common.inject.binder.LinkedBindingBuilder#toProvider(Provider)}.
 * In this case all constructors are, of course, ignored.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In all cases, a member can be injected regardless of its Java access
 * specifier (private, default, protected, public).

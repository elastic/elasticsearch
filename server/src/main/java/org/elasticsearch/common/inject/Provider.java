/**
 * An object capable of providing instances of type {@code T}. Providers are used in numerous ways
 * by Guice:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the default means for obtaining instances (an injectable or parameterless constructor)
 * is insufficient for a particular binding, the module can specify a custom {@code Provider}
 * instead, to control exactly how Guice creates or obtains instances for the binding.
 * <li>An implementation class may always choose to have a {@code Provider<T>} instance injected,
 * rather than having a {@code T} injected directly.  This may give you access to multiple
 * instances, instances you wish to safely mutate and discard, instances which are out of scope
 * (e.g. using a {@code @RequestScoped} object from within a {@code @SessionScoped} object), or
 * instances that will be initialized lazily.
 * <li>A custom {@link Scope} is implemented as a decorator of {@code Provider<T>}, which decides
 * when to delegate to the backing provider and when to provide the instance some other way.
 * <li>The {@link Injector} offers access to the {@code Provider<T>} it uses to fulfill requests
 * for a given key, via the {@link Injector#getProvider} methods.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of object this provides

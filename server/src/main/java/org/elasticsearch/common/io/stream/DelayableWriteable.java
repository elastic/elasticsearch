/**
 * A holder for {@link Writeable}s that delays reading the underlying object
 * on the receiving end. To be used for objects whose deserialized
 * representation is inefficient to keep in memory compared to their
 * corresponding serialized representation.
 * The node that produces the {@link Writeable} calls {@link #referencing(Writeable)}
 * to create a {@link DelayableWriteable} that serializes the inner object
 * first to a buffer and writes the content of the buffer to the {@link StreamOutput}.
 * The receiver node calls {@link #delayed(Reader, StreamInput)} to create a
 * {@link DelayableWriteable} that reads the buffer from the @link {@link StreamInput}
 * but delays creating the actual object by calling {@link #expand()} when needed.
 * Multiple {@link DelayableWriteable}s coming from different nodes may be buffered
 * on the receiver end, which may hold a mix of {@link DelayableWriteable}s that were
 * produced locally (hence expanded) as well as received form another node (hence subject
 * to delayed expansion). When such objects are buffered for some time it may be desirable
 * to force their buffering in serialized format by calling
 * {@link #asSerialized(Reader, NamedWriteableRegistry)}.

/**
 * A cache of a single object whose refresh process can be cancelled. The cached value is computed lazily on the first retrieval, and
 * associated with a key which is used to determine its freshness for subsequent retrievals.
 * <p>
 * This is useful for things like computing stats over cluster metadata: the first time stats are requested they are computed, but
 * subsequent calls re-use the computed value as long as they pertain to the same metadata version. If stats are requested for a different
 * metadata version then the cached value is dropped and a new one is computed.
 * <p>
 * Retrievals happen via the async {@link #get} method. If a retrieval is cancelled (e.g. the channel on which to return the stats is
 * closed) then the computation carries on running in case another retrieval for the same key arrives in future. However if all of the
 * retrievals for a key are cancelled <i>and</i> a retrieval occurs for a fresher key then the computation itself is cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Cancellation is based on polling: the {@link #refresh} method checks whether it should abort whenever it is convenient to do so, which in
 * turn checks all the pending retrievals to see whether they have been cancelled.
 *
 * @param <Input> The type of the input to the computation of the cached value.
 * @param <Key>   The key type. The cached value is associated with a key, and subsequent {@link #get} calls compare keys of the given input
 *                value to determine whether the cached value is fresh or not. See {@link #isFresh}.
 * @param <Value> The type of the cached value.

     * @param listener           A {@link ActionListener} which should be notified when the computation completes. If the computation fails
     *                           by calling {@link ActionListener#onFailure} then the result is returned to the pending listeners but is not

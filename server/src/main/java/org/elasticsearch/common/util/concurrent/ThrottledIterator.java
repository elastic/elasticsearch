     * to an executor).
     *
     * @param iterator The items to iterate. May be accessed by multiple threads, but accesses are all protected by synchronizing on itself.
     * @param itemConsumer The operation to perform on each item. Each operation receives a {@link RefCounted} which can be used to track
     *                     the execution of any background tasks spawned for this item. This operation may run on the thread which
     *                     originally called {@link #run}, if this method has not yet returned. Otherwise it will run on a thread on which a
     *                     background task previously called {@link RefCounted#decRef()} on its ref count. This operation should not throw
     *                     any exceptions.
     * @param maxConcurrency The maximum number of ongoing operations at any time.
     * @param onItemCompletion Executed when each item is completed, which can be used for instance to report on progress. Must not throw
     *                         exceptions.
     * @param onCompletion     Executed when all items are completed.

/**
 * A Trie structure for analysing byte streams for duplicate sequences. Bytes
 * from a stream are added one at a time using the addByte method and the number
 * of times it has been seen as part of a sequence is returned.
 * <p>
 * The minimum required length for a duplicate sequence detected is 6 bytes.
 * <p>
 * The design goals are to maximize speed of lookup while minimizing the space
 * required to do so. This has led to a hybrid solution for representing the
 * bytes that make up a sequence in the trie.
 * <p>
 * If we have 6 bytes in sequence e.g. abcdef then they are represented as
 * object nodes in the tree as follows:
 * <p>
 * (a)-(b)-(c)-(def as an int)
 * <p>
 * {@link RootTreeNode} objects are used for the first two levels of the tree
 * (representing bytes a and b in the example sequence). The combinations of
 * objects at these 2 levels are few so internally these objects allocate an
 * array of 256 child node objects to quickly address children by indexing
 * directly into the densely packed array using a byte value. The third level in
 * the tree holds {@link LightweightTreeNode} nodes that have few children
 * (typically much less than 256) and so use a dynamically-grown array to hold
 * child nodes as simple int primitives. These ints represent the final 3 bytes
 * of a sequence and also hold a count of the number of times the entire sequence
 * path has been visited (count is a single byte).
 * <p>
 * The Trie grows indefinitely as more content is added and while theoretically
 * it could be massive (a 6-depth tree could produce 256^6 nodes) non-random
 * content e.g English text contains fewer variations.
 * <p>
 * In future we may look at using one of these strategies when memory is tight:
 * <ol>
 * <li>auto-pruning methods to remove less-visited parts of the tree
 * <li>auto-reset to wipe the whole tree and restart when a memory threshold is
 * reached
 * <li>halting any growth of the tree
 * </ol>
 * Tests on real-world-text show that the size of the tree is a multiple of the
 * input text where that multiplier varies between 10 and 5 times as the content
 * size increased from 10 to 100 megabytes of content.

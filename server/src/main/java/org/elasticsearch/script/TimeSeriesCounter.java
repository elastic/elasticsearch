/**
 * Provides a counter with a history of 5m/15m/24h.
 *
 * Callers increment the counter and query the current state of the TimeSeries.
 *
 * {@link TimeSeriesCounter#inc()} increments the counter to indicate an event happens "now", with metadata about "now"
 * from the given {@link TimeSeriesCounter#timeProvider}.
 *
 * {@link TimeSeriesCounter#timeSeries()} provides a snapshot of the counters at the current time, given by
 * {@link TimeSeriesCounter#timeProvider}.  The snapshot includes the number of events in the last five minutes, the last fifteen
 * minutes, the last twenty-four hours and an all-time count.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * * If the timeProvider produces a time stamp value, {@code t[j]} that occurs _before_ an earlier invocation {@code t[j]} (where j is an
 *   invocation that *happens-before*, in the java memory model sense), the time stamp is treated as occurring at the latest time seen,
 *   {@code t[latest]}, EXCEPT if {@code t[latest] - t[j]} is earlier than any time covered by the twenty-four counter.  If that occurs,
 *   time goes backwards more than 24 hours (between 24:00 and 23:45 depending on the circumstance) the history is reset but total is
 *   retained.
 * * All counters have a resolution:
 *   - 5m resolution is 15s
 *   - 15m resolution is 90s
 *   - 24h resolution is 15m
 *   The counter will drop events between one second and the resolution minus one second during a bucket rollover.

         * it would be impossible to distinguish between two times that are `duration` away from each other.
         * In this example, the first inc used time 235, since startOfCurrentEpoch is rounded down to the nearest
         * duration (100), it is 200.

         * curBucket = 1 = (t / resolution) % buckets.length = (235 / 20) % 5
         * The latest active bucket in the bucket ring.  The bucket of a timestamp is determined by the `resolution`.

         * second covers 220->239, the third 240->259 and so on.  235 is in the second bucket, at index 1.

         * advances to or past zero, `startOfCurrentEpoch` must be updated to `nextEpoch()`

         * `curBucket` covers the latest timestamp seen by the `Counter`.  Since the counter keeps a history, when a
         * caller calls `sum(t)`, the `Counter` must clamp the range to the earliest time covered by its current state.
         * The times proceed backwards for `buckets.length - 1`.

         * counterExpired() = 320 = startOfCurrentEpoch + (curBucket * resolution) + duration = 200 + (1 * 20) + 100
         * Where `earliestTimeInCounter()` is looking backwards, to the history covered by the counter, `counterExpired()`
         * looks forward to when current counter has expired.  Since `curBucket` represents the latest time in this counter,
         * `counterExpired()` is `duration` from the start of the time covered from `curBucket`

         *                    the counter, 240 to 259.
         *   1) calculate start = 321 - duration = 321 - 100 = 221
         *   2) start is before the nextBucketStartTime (340), so sum does not terminate early

         *
         * Action: sum(465) - This sum is so far in the future, it does not overlap with any bucket in range
         *   1) calculate start = 465 - duration = 465 - 100 = 365
         *   2) start is greater than or equal to the nextBucketStartTime (340), so we know the counter has no contexts
         *      -> return 0
         *
         * Action: sum(439) - This sum starts _after_ the last update, which is at 321, but because of the bucket resolution
         *                    sum still catches the value bucket 1, times 320 to 339.
         *   1) calculate start = 439 - duration = 439 - 100 = 339
         *   2) start is before nextBucketStartTime(340), so sum does not terminate early
         *   3) start is after earliestTimeInCounter (240), so it is now updated
         *   4) bucket(start) = 1 which is curBucket, so the for loop falls through

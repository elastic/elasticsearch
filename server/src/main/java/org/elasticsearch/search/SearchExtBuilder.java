/**
 * Intermediate serializable representation of a search ext section. To be subclassed by plugins that support
 * a custom section as part of a search request, which will be provided within the ext element.
 * Any state needs to be serialized as part of the {@link Writeable#writeTo(StreamOutput)} method and
 * read from the incoming stream, usually done adding a constructor that takes {@link StreamInput} as
 * an argument.
 *
 * Registration happens through {@link SearchPlugin#getSearchExts()}, which also needs a {@link CheckedFunction} that's able to parse
 * the incoming request from the REST layer into the proper {@link SearchExtBuilder} subclass.
 *
 * {@link #getWriteableName()} must return the same name as the one used for the registration
 * of the {@link SearchExtSpec}.

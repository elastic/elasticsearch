/**
 * Ensures that unit tests are subject to entitlement checks.
 * This is a "meta test" because it tests that the tests are working:
 * if these tests fail, it means other tests won't be correctly detecting
 * entitlement enforcement errors.
 * <p>
 * It may seem strange to have this test where it is, rather than in the entitlement library.
 * There's a reason for that.
 * <p>
 * To exercise entitlement enforcement, we must attempt an operation that should be denied.
 * This necessitates some operation that fails the entitlement check,
 * and it must be in production code (or else we'd also need {@link WithEntitlementsOnTestCode},
 * and we don't want to require that here).
 * Naturally, there are very few candidates, because most code doesn't fail entitlement checks:
 * really just the entitlement self-test we do at startup. Hence, that's what we use here.
 * <p>
 * Since we want to call the self-test, which is in the server, we can't call it
 * from a place like the entitlement library tests, because those deliberately do not
 * have a dependency on the server code. Hence, this test lives here in the server tests.

=== Privileges

[[privileges-list-cluster]]

[float]
==== Cluster

[horizontal]
`all`:: All cluster administration operations, like snapshotting, node shutdown/restart, settings update or rerouting
`monitor`:: All cluster read-ony operations, like cluster health & state, hot threads, node info, node & cluster
stats, snapshot/restore status, pending cluster tasks
`manage_shield`:: All Shield related operations (currently only exposing an API for clearing the realm caches)

[[privileges-list-indices]]

[float]
==== Indices

[horizontal]
`all`:: Any action on an index
`manage`:: All `monitor` privileges plus index administration (aliases, analyze, cache clear, close, delete, exists,
flush, mapping, open, force merge, refresh, settings, search shards, templates, validate, warmers)
`monitor`:: All actions, that are required for monitoring and read-only (recovery, segments info, index stats & status)
`data_access`:: A shortcut of all of the below privileges
`crud`:: A shortcut of `read` and `write` privileges
`read`:: Read only access to actions (count, explain, get, mget, get indexed scripts, more like this, multi
percolate/search/termvector), percolate, scroll, clear_scroll, search, suggest, tv)
`search`:: All of `suggest` and executing an arbitrary search request (including multi-search API)
`get`:: Allow to execute a GET request for a single document or multiple documents via the multi-get API
`suggest`:: Allow to execute the `_suggest` API
`index`:: Privilege to index and update documents
`create_index`:: Privilege to create an index. A create index request may contain aliases to be added to the index once
created. In that case the request requires `manage_aliases` privilege as well, on both the index and the aliases names.
`manage_aliases`:: Privilege to add and remove aliases, as well as retrieve aliases information. Note that in order
to add an alias to an existing index, the `manage_aliases` privilege is required on the existing index as well as on the
alias name
`delete`:: Privilege to delete documents (includes delete by query)
`write`:: Privilege to index, update, delete, delete by query and bulk operations on documents, in addition to delete
and put indexed scripts

[float]
==== Run As

The `run_as` permission enables an authenticated user to submit requests on behalf of another 
user. The value can be a user name or a comma-separated list of user names. (You can also specify 
users as an array of strings or a YAML sequence.) For more information, 
see <<submitting-requests-for-other-users, Submitting Requests on Behalf of Other Users>>.

==== Action level privileges

Although rarely needed, it is also possible to define privileges on specific actions that are available in
Elasticsearch. This only applies to publicly available indices and cluster actions.

===== Cluster actions privileges

* `cluster:admin/render/template/search`
* `cluster:admin/repository/delete`
* `cluster:admin/repository/get`
* `cluster:admin/repository/put`

NOTE: While indices template actions typically relate to indices, they are categorized under cluster actions to avoid
      potential security leaks. For example, having one user define a template that matches another user's index.

=== Files used by Shield

The Shield security plugin uses the following files:

* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/roles.yml` defines the roles in use on the cluster (read more <<defining-roles,here>>).
* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/users` defines the hashed passwords for users on the cluster (read more <<users-file,here>>).
* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/users_roles` defines the role assignments for users on the cluster (read more <<users_defining-roles,here>>).
* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/role_mapping.yml` defines the role assignments for a Distinguished Name (DN) to a role. This allows for
LDAP and Active Directory groups and users and PKI users to be mapped to roles (read more <<ldap-role-mapping,here>>).
* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/logging.yml` contains audit information (read more <<logging-file,here>>).
* `CONFIG_DIR/shield/system_key` holds a cluster secret key used for message authentication. For more information, see <<enable-message-authentication,Enabling Message Authentication>>.

[[ref-shield-files-location]]
IMPORTANT: Any files that Shield uses must be stored in the Elasticsearch {ref}/setup-dir-layout.html#setup-dir-layout[configuration directory].
Elasticsearch runs with restricted permissions and is only permitted to read from the locations configured in the directory
layout for enhanced security.

Several of these files are in the YAML format. When you edit these files, be aware that YAML is indentation-level
sensitive and indentation errors can lead to configuration errors. Avoid the tab character to set indentation levels,
or use an editor that automatically expands tabs to spaces.

Be careful to properly escape YAML constructs such as `:` or leading exclamation points within quoted strings. Using
the `|` or `>` characters to define block literals instead of escaping the problematic characters can help avoid
problems.

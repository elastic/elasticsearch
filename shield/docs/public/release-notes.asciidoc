=== Version Compatibility

You must run the version of Shield that matches the version of Elasticsearch you are running. For
example, Shield {version} requires Elasticsearch {version}.

[[upgrade-instructions]]
=== Upgrading Shield

To upgrade Shield, just uninstall the current Shield plugin and install the new version of Shield. Your configuration
will be preserved and you do this with a rolling upgrade of Elasticsearch when upgrading to a new minor version; a full
cluster restart is required when upgrading from Elasticsearch 1.x. On each node, after you have stopped it run:

[source,shell]
---------------------------------------------------
bin/plugin remove shield
bin/plugin install shield
---------------------------------------------------

Then start the node. Larger sites should follow the steps in the {ref}/rolling-upgrades.html[rolling upgrade section]
to ensure recovery is as quick as possible.

On upgrade, your current configuration files will remain untouched. The configuration files provided by the new version
of Shield will be added with a `.new` extension.

==== Updated Role Definitions
The default role definitions in the `roles.yml` file may need to be changed to ensure proper functionality with other
applications such as Marvel and Kibana. Any role changes will be found in `roles.yml.new` after upgrading to the new
version of Shield. We recommend copying the changes listed below to your `roles.yml` file.

* added[2.0.0] The permission on all the roles are updated to the verbose format to make it easier to enable field level and document level security. The `transport_client` role has been updated to work with Elasticsearch 2.0.0.
 The `marvel_user` role has been updated to work with Marvel 2.0 and a `remote_marvel_agent` role has been added. The `kibana3` and `marvel_agent` roles have been removed.
* added[1.1.0] `kibana4_server` role added that defines the minimum set of permissions necessary for the Kibana 4 server.
* added[1.0.1] `kibana4` role updated to work with new features in Kibana 4 RC1

.Breaking Changes 
* Same as 2.0.1. <<setting-up-field-and-document-level-security, Document and Field Level Security>> is now disabled by default. Set `shield.dls_fls.enabled` to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml` to enable it. You cannot submit `_bulk` update requests when document and field level security is enabled.

[float]
==== 2.0.1
November 24, 2015

.Breaking Changes
* <<setting-up-field-and-document-level-security, Document and Field Level Security>> is now disabled by default. Set `shield.dls_fls.enabled` to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml` to enable it. You cannot submit `_bulk` update requests when document and field level security is enabled.

[float]
==== 2.0.0
October 28, 2015

.Breaking Changes
* All files that Shield uses must be kept in the <<ref-shield-files-location, configuration directory>> due to the enhanced security of Elasticsearch 2.0.
* The network format has been changed from all previous versions of Shield and a full cluster restart is required to upgrade to Shield 2.0.

.New Features
* <<setting-up-field-and-document-level-security, Document and Field Level Security>> support has been added and can be
configured per role.
* Support for <<custom-realms, custom authentication realms>> has been added, allowing Shield to integrate with more authentication sources and methods.
* <<submitting-requests-for-other-users, User impersonation support>> has also been added, which allows a user to send a request to elasticsearch that will be run
with the specified user's permissions.

.Bug Fixes
* <<configuring-auditing, Auditing>> now captures requests from nodes using a different system key as tampered requests.
* The <<audit-index, index output for auditing>> stores the type of request when available.
* `esusers` and `syskeygen` work when spaces are in the elasticsearch installation path.
* Fixed a rare issue where authentication fails even when the username and password are correct.

[float]
==== 1.3.2
August 10, 2015

.Bug Fixes
* When using the <<ldap-user-search,LDAP user search>> mechanism, connection errors during startup no longer cause the node to stop.
* The <<cache-eviction-api,Cache Eviction API>> no longer generates invalid JSON.
* The <<audit-index,index output for auditing>> starts properly when forwarding the audit events to a remote cluster and uses
the correct user to index the audit events.

[float]
==== 1.3.1
July 21, 2015

.Bug Fixes
* Fixes <<enable-message-authentication,message authentication>> serialization to work with Shield 1.2.1 and earlier.
** NOTE: if you are upgrading from Shield 1.3.0 or Shield 1.2.2 a {ref-17}/setup-upgrade.html#restart-upgrade[cluster restart upgrade]
will be necessary. When upgrading from other versions of Shield, follow the normal <<upgrade-instructions,upgrade procedure>>.

[float]
==== 1.3.0
June 24, 2015

.Breaking Changes
* The `sha2` and `apr1` hashing algorithms have been removed as options for the <<ref-cache-hash-algo,`cache.hash_algo` setting>>.
  If your existing Shield installation uses either of these options, remove the setting and use the default `ssha256`
  algorithm.
* The `users` file now only supports `bcrypt` password hashing. All existing passwords stored using the `esusers` tool
  have been hashed with `bcrypt` and are not affected.

.New Features
* <<pki,PKI Realm>>: Adds Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication through the use of X.509 certificates in place of
 username and password credentials.
* <<configuring-auditing, Index Output for Audit Events>>: An index based output has been added for storing audit events in an Elasticsearch index.

.Enhancements
* TLS 1.2 is now the default protocol.
* Clients that do not support pre-emptive basic authentication can now support both anonymous and authenticated access
  by specifying the `shield.authc.anonymous.authz_exception` <<anonymous-access,setting>> with a value of `false`.
* Reduced logging for common SSL exceptions, such as a client closing the connection during a handshake.

.Bug Fixes
* The `esusers` and `syskeygen` tools now work correctly with environment variables in the RPM and DEB installation
  environment files `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` and `/etc/default/elasticsearch`.
* Default ciphers no longer include `TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`.

[float]
==== 1.2.3
July 21, 2015

.Bug Fixes
* Fixes <<enable-message-authentication,message authentication>> serialization to work with Shield 1.2.1 and earlier.
** NOTE: if you are upgrading from Shield 1.2.2 a {ref-17}/setup-upgrade.html#restart-upgrade[cluster restart upgrade]
will be necessary. When upgrading from other versions of Shield, follow the normal <<upgrade-instructions,upgrade procedure>>.

[float]

.Bug Fixes
* The `esusers` tool no longer warns about missing roles that are properly defined in the `roles.yml` file.
* The period character, `.`, is now allowed in usernames and role names.
* The {ref-17}/query-dsl-terms-filter.html#_caching_19[terms filter lookup cache] has been disabled to ensure all requests
  are properly authorized. This removes the need to manually disable the terms filter cache.
* For LDAP client connections, only the protocols and ciphers specified in the `shield.ssl.supported_protocols` and
  `shield.ssl.ciphers` <<ref-ssl-tls-settings,settings>> will be used.
* The auditing mechanism now logs authentication failed events when a request contains an invalid authentication token.

for more information.

* Authentication:
** <<anonymous-access, Anonymous access>> is now supported (disabled by default).

* Updated `kibana4` permissions to be compatible with Kibana 4 RC1
* Ensure the mandatory `base_dn` settings is set in the `ldap` realm configuration

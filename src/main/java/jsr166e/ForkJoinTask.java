/**
 * Abstract base class for tasks that run within a {@link ForkJoinPool}.
 * A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a thread-like entity that is much
 * lighter weight than a normal thread.  Huge numbers of tasks and
 * subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
 * ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.
 *
 * <p>A "main" {@code ForkJoinTask} begins execution when it is
 * explicitly submitted to a {@link ForkJoinPool}, or, if not already
 * engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the {@link
 * ForkJoinPool#commonPool()} via {@link #fork}, {@link #invoke}, or
 * related methods.  Once started, it will usually in turn start other
 * subtasks.  As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
 * using {@code ForkJoinTask} employ only methods {@link #fork} and
 * {@link #join}, or derivatives such as {@link
 * #invokeAll(ForkJoinTask...) invokeAll}.  However, this class also
 * provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
 * advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
 * of new forms of fork/join processing.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinTask} is a lightweight form of {@link Future}.
 * The efficiency of {@code ForkJoinTask}s stems from a set of
 * restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
 * reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
 * functions or operating on purely isolated objects.  The primary
 * coordination mechanisms are {@link #fork}, that arranges
 * asynchronous execution, and {@link #join}, that doesn't proceed
 * until the task's result has been computed.  Computations should
 * ideally avoid {@code synchronized} methods or blocks, and should
 * minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
 * tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
 * cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
 * not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
 * are completely independent of those accessed by other running
 * tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
 * checked exceptions such as {@code IOExceptions} to be
 * thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
 * exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
 * them. These exceptions may additionally include {@link
 * RejectedExecutionException} stemming from internal resource
 * exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
 * queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
 * exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
 * for example using {@code ex.printStackTrace()}) of both the thread
 * that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
 * encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
 * but doing do requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
 * of few if any <em>other</em> tasks should be dependent on a task
 * that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
 * tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing {@link
 * CountedCompleter}) often fall into this category.  (2) To minimize
 * resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
 * (possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the {@link
 * ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker} API is used, or the number of possibly
 * blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's {@link
 * ForkJoinPool#getParallelism} level, the pool cannot guarantee that
 * enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
 * performance.
 *
 * <p>The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
 * results of a task is {@link #join}, but there are several variants:
 * The {@link Future#get} methods support interruptible and/or timed
 * waits for completion and report results using {@code Future}
 * conventions. Method {@link #invoke} is semantically
 * equivalent to {@code fork(); join()} but always attempts to begin
 * execution in the current thread. The "<em>quiet</em>" forms of
 * these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
 * may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
 * to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
 * Method {@code invokeAll} (available in multiple versions)
 * performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
 * of tasks and joining them all.
 *
 * <p>In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
 * (fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
 * the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
 * should be performed innermost-first. For example, {@code a.fork();
 * b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();} is likely to be substantially more
 * efficient than joining {@code a} before {@code b}.
 *
 * <p>The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
 * of detail: {@link #isDone} is true if a task completed in any way
 * (including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);
 * {@link #isCompletedNormally} is true if a task completed without
 * cancellation or encountering an exception; {@link #isCancelled} is
 * true if the task was cancelled (in which case {@link #getException}
 * returns a {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}); and
 * {@link #isCompletedAbnormally} is true if a task was either
 * cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case {@link
 * #getException} will return either the encountered exception or
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException}.
 *
 * <p>The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
 * Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
 * particular style of fork/join processing, typically {@link
 * RecursiveAction} for most computations that do not return results,
 * {@link RecursiveTask} for those that do, and {@link
 * CountedCompleter} for those in which completed actions trigger
 * other actions.  Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
 * fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
 * then defines a {@code compute} method that somehow uses the control
 * methods supplied by this base class.
 *
 * <p>Method {@link #join} and its variants are appropriate for use
 * only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
 * parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
 * (DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
 * tasks cyclically wait for each other.  However, this framework
 * supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser Phaser}, {@link #helpQuiesce}, and {@link #complete}) that
 * may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
 * are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
 * ForkJoinTask may be atomically <em>tagged</em> with a {@code short}
 * value using {@link #setForkJoinTaskTag} or {@link
 * #compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag} and checked using {@link
 * #getForkJoinTaskTag}. The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
 * these {@code protected} methods or tags for any purpose, but they
 * may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses.  For
 * example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
 * avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
 * (Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
 * of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)
 *
 * <p>Most base support methods are {@code final}, to prevent
 * overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
 * underlying lightweight task scheduling framework.  Developers
 * creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
 * implement {@code protected} methods {@link #exec}, {@link
 * #setRawResult}, and {@link #getRawResult}, while also introducing
 * an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
 * subclasses, possibly relying on other {@code protected} methods
 * provided by this class.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
 * computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
 * usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
 * a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
 * computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
 * are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
 * small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
 * overwhelm processing.
 *
 * <p>This class provides {@code adapt} methods for {@link Runnable}
 * and {@link Callable}, that may be of use when mixing execution of
 * {@code ForkJoinTasks} with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
 * of this form, consider using a pool constructed in <em>asyncMode</em>.
 *
 * <p>ForkJoinTasks are {@code Serializable}, which enables them to be
 * used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
 * sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
 * execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

     * The status field holds run control status bits packed into a
     * single int to minimize footprint and to ensure atomicity (via
     * CAS).  Status is initially zero, and takes on nonnegative
     * values until completed, upon which status (anded with
     * DONE_MASK) holds value NORMAL, CANCELLED, or EXCEPTIONAL. Tasks
     * undergoing blocking waits by other threads have the SIGNAL bit
     * set.  Completion of a stolen task with SIGNAL set awakens any
     * waiters via notifyAll. Even though suboptimal for some
     * purposes, we use basic builtin wait/notify to take advantage of
     * "monitor inflation" in JVMs that we would otherwise need to
     * emulate to avoid adding further per-task bookkeeping overhead.
     * We want these monitors to be "fat", i.e., not use biasing or
     * thin-lock techniques, so use some odd coding idioms that tend
     * to avoid them, mainly by arranging that every synchronized
     * block performs a wait, notifyAll or both.
     *
     * These control bits occupy only (some of) the upper half (16
     * bits) of status field. The lower bits are used for user-defined
     * tags.

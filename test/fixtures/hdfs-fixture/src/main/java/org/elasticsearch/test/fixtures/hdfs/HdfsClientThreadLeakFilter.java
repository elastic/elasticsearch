/**
 * In Hadoop 2.8.0, there is a thread that is started by the filesystem to clean up old execution stats.
 * This thread ignores all interrupts, catching InterruptedException, logging it, and continuing on
 * with its work. The thread is a daemon, so it thankfully does not stop the JVM from closing, and it
 * is started only once in a class's static initialization. This currently breaks our testing as this
 * thread leaks out of the client and is picked up by the test framework. This thread filter is meant
 * to ignore the offending thread until a version of Hadoop is released that addresses the incorrect
 * interrupt handling.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12829">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12829</a>

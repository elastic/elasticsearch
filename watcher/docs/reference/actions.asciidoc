[[actions]]
=== Actions

The actions associated with a watch are executed whenever the watch is executed, its condition 
is met, and the watch is not throttled. The actions are executed one at a time and each action
executes independently from the others. Any failures encountered while executing an action are
recorded in the action result and in the watch history.

NOTE:	If no actions are defined for a watch, no actions are executed. However, a `watch_record`
		is still written to the <<watch-history, Watch History>>.

Actions have access to the payload in the execution context. They can use it to support their 
execution in any way they need. For example, the payload might serve as a model for a templated
email body.

=== Acknowledgement and Throttling

During the watch execution, once the condition is met, a decision is made per configured action 
as to whether it should be throttled. The main purpose of action throttling is to prevent too 
many executions of the same action for the same watch.

For example, suppose you have a watch that detects errors in an application's log entries. The 
watch is triggered every five minutes and searches for errors during the last hour. In this case,
if there are errors, there is a period of time where the watch is checked and its actions are 
executed multiple times based on the same errors. As a result, the system administrator receives
multiple notifications about the same issue, which can be annoying.

To address this issue, Watcher supports time-based throttling. You can define a throttling
period as part of the action configuration to limit how often the action is executed. When you
set a throttling period, Watcher prevents repeated execution of the action if it has already
executed within the throttling period time frame (`now - throttling period`).

The following snippet shows a watch for the scenario described above - associating a throttle 
period with the `email_administrator` action:

[source,json]
.Watch Definition Example
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/log_event_watch
{
  "metadata" : {
    "color" : "red"
  },
  "trigger" : {
    "schedule" : {
      "interval" : "5m"
    }
  },
  "input" : {
    "search" : {
      "request" : {
        "indices" : "log-events",
        "body" : {
          "size" : 0,
          "query" : { "match" : { "status" : "error" } }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "condition" : {
    "script" : "return ctx.payload.hits.total > 5"
  },
  "actions" : {
    "email_administrator" : {
      "throttle_period": "15m", <1>
      "email" : { <2>
        "to" : "sys.admino@host.domain",
        "subject" : "Encountered {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors",
        "body" : "Too many error in the system, see attached data",
        "attach_data" : true,
        "priority" : "high"
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// AUTOSENSE

<1> There will be at least 15 minutes between subsequent `email_administrator` action executions.
<2> See <<actions-email, Email Action>> for more information.

You can also define a throttle period at the watch level. The watch-level throttle period serves 
as the default throttle period for all of the actions defined in the watch:

[source,json]
.Watch Definition Example
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/log_event_watch
{
  "trigger" : {
    ...
  },
  "input" : {
    ...
  },
  "condition" : {
    ...
  },
  "throttle_period" : "15m", <1>
  "actions" : {
    "email_administrator" : {
      "email" : {
        "to" : "sys.admino@host.domain",
        "subject" : "Encountered {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors",
        "body" : "Too many error in the system, see attached data",
        "attach_data" : true,
        "priority" : "high"
      }
    },
    "notify_pager" : {
      "webhook" : {
        "method" : "POST",
        "host" : "pager.service.domain",
        "port" : 1234,
        "path" : "/{{watch_id}}",
        "body" : "Encountered {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors"
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> There will be at least 15 minutes between subsequent action executions (applies to both 
	`email_administrator` and `notify_pager` actions)

If you do not define a throttle period at the action or watch level, the global default 
throttle period is applied. Initially, this is set to 5 seconds. To change the global default,
configure the `watcher.execution.default_throttle_period` setting in `elasticsearch.yml`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
watcher.execution.default_throttle_period: 15m
--------------------------------------------------

Watcher also supports acknowledgement-based throttling. You can acknowledge a watch using the
<<api-rest-ack-watch, Ack Watch API>> to prevent the watch actions from being executed again 
while the watch condition remains `true`. This essentially tells Watcher "I received the 
notification and I'm handling it, please do not notify me about this error again".
An acknowledged watch action remains in the `acked` state until the watch's condition evaluates
to `false`. When that happens, the action's state changes to `awaits_successful_execution`.

To acknowledge an action, you use the `ack` API:

[source,js]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/<id>/_ack?actions=<action_ids>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
// AUTOSENSE

Where `<id>` is the id of the watch and `<action_ids>` is a comma-separated list of the action
ids you want to acknowledge. To acknowledge all actions, omit the `actions` parameter.

The following diagram illustrates the throttling decisions made for each action of a watch
during its execution:

Watcher supports six action types: <<actions-email, Email>>,
<<actions-webhook, Webhook>>, <<actions-index, Index>>,
<<actions-logging, Logging>>, <<actions-hipchat, HipChat>>
and <<actions-slack, Slack>>.

[[condition]]
=== Condition

When a watch is triggered, its condition determines whether or not to execute its actions.
Watcher supports four condition types: <<condition-always, `always`>>, <<condition-never, `never`>>, 
<<condition-script, `script`>> and <<condition-compare, `compare`>>.

NOTE: If you omit the condition definition from a watch, the condition defaults to `always`. 

When a condition is evaluated, it has full access to the watch execution context, including the watch payload (`ctx.payload.*`). 
The <<condition-script, script>>, <<condition-compare, compare>>  and <<condition-array-compare, array-compare>>
conditions can use the data in the payload to determine whether or not the necessary conditions have been met.

==== PUT Watch API

The PUT watch API either registers a new watch in watcher or update an existing one. Once registered, a new document
will be added to the `.watches` index, representing the watch, and the watch's trigger will immediately be registered
with the relevant trigger engine (typically the scheduler, for the `schedule` trigger).

IMPORTANT:  Putting a watch must be done via this API only. Do not put a watch directly to the `.watches` index
            using Elasticsearch's Index API. When integrating with Shield, a best practice is to make sure
            no `write` privileges are granted to anyone over the `.watches` API.


The following example adds a watch with the `my-watch` id that has the following qualities:

* The watch schedule triggers every minute.
* The watch search input finds any 404 HTTP responses that occurred in the past five minutes.
* The watch condition checks the search results for 404s.
* The watch action sends an email if there are any 404s.

// AUTOSENSE

A watch has the following fields:

[options="header"]
|======
| Name              | Description 
| `trigger`         | The <<trigger, trigger>> that defines when the watch should run
| `input`           | The <<input, input>> that defines the input that loads the data for the watch
| `condition`       | The <<condition, condition>> that defines if the actions should be run
| `actions`         | The list of <<actions, actions>> that will be run if the condition matches
| `meta`            | Metadata json that will be copied into the history entries.
| `throttle_period` | The minimum time between actions being run, the default for this is 5 seconds. This default can be changed in the config file with the setting `watcher.throttle.period.default_period`.
|======


===== Timeouts

When updating a watch while it is executing, the put action will block and wait for the watch execution
to finish. Depending on the nature of the watch, in some situations this can take a while. For this reason,
the put watch action is associated with a timeout that is set to 10 seconds by default. You can control this
timeout by passing in the `master_timeout` parameter.

The following snippet shows how to change the default timeout of the put action to 30 seconds:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/my-watch?master_timeout=30s
--------------------------------------------------

[[api-rest-put-watch-active-state]]
===== Controlling Default Active State

When adding a watch you can also define its initial <<watch-active-state, active state>>. You do that by
setting the `active` parameter. The following command add a watch and sets it to be inactive by default:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/my-watch?active=false
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you omit the `active` parameter, the watch is set to the active state by default.

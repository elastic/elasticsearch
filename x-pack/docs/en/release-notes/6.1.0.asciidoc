[[xes-breaking-6.1.0]]
[float]
=== Breaking changes

Security::
* The `certgen` command now returns validation errors when it encounters problems
reading from an input file (with the `-in` command option). Previously these
errors might have been ignored or caused the command to abort with unclear
messages. For more information, see <<certgen>>.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2711[#2711]

[[xes-feature-6.1.0]]
[float]
=== New features

Machine Learning::

* Added the ability to create job forecasts. This feature enables you to use
historical behavior to predict the future behavior of your time series. You can
create forecasts in {kib} or by using the <<ml-forecast,forecast jobs>> API.
+
--
NOTE: You cannot create forecasts for jobs that were created in previous
versions; this functionality is available only for jobs created in 6.1 or later.

=== Enhancements

Machine Learning::

* Improved the way {ml} jobs are allocated to nodes, such that it is primarily
determined by the estimated memory requirement of the job. If there is insufficient
information about the job's memory requirements, the allocation decision is based
on job counts per node.
//TBD: Is "model size" clearer than "model footprint"?
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2975[#2975] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/546[#546])
* Increased the default value of the `xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting from `10`
to `20`. The allocation of jobs to nodes now considers memory usage as well as
job counts, so it's reasonable to permit more small jobs on a single node. For
more information, see <<ml-settings>>.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/3141[#3141] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2975[#2975])
* Decreased the default `model_memory_limit` property value to 1 GB for new jobs.
If you want to create a job that analyzes high cardinality fields, you can
increase this property value. For more information, see <<ml-apilimits>>.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2300[#2300] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/546[#546])
* Improved analytics related to decay rates when predictions are very accurate.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/420[#420]
* Improved analytics related to detecting non-negative quantities and using this
information to constrain analysis, predictions, and confidence intervals.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/415[#415] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/414[#414])
* Improved periodic trough or spike detection.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/326[#326] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/303[#303])
* Improved the speed of the aggregation of {ml} results.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/318[#318] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/267[#267])
* Improved probability calculation performance.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/315[#315]
* Expedited bucket processing time in very large populations by determining when
there are nearly duplicate values in a bucket and de-duplicating the samples that
are added to the model.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/313[#313] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/268[#268])
* Improved handling of periodically missing values.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/309[#309] (issues: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/303[#303], https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/305[#305])
* Improved analytics related to diurnal periodicity.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/305[#305] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/299[#299])
* Reduced memory usage during population analysis by releasing redundant memory
after the bucket results are written.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/391[#391] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/297[#297])
* Improved modeling of long periodic components, particularly when there is a
long bucket span.
// https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/pull/298[#298] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp/issues/272[#272])

Monitoring::
* Added the new `interval_ms` field to monitoring documents. This field
indicates the current collection interval for {es} or external monitored systems.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2650[#2650]

Security::
* Added the `manage_index_templates` cluster privilege to the built-in role
`kibana_system`. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster[Cluster Privileges]
and {xpack-ref}/built-in-roles.html[Built-in Roles].
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/3009[#3009] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2937[#2937])
* Newly created or updated watches execute with the privileges of the user that
last modified the watch.
//https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2808[#2808] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2201[#2201])
* Added log messages when a PEM key is found when a PEM certificate was
expected (or vice versa) in the `xpack.ssl.key` or `xpack.ssl.certificate` settings.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2670[#2670] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2657[#2657])
* Added the new `certutil` command to simplify the creation of certificates for
use with the Elastic stack. For more information, see <<certutil>>.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2561[#2561] (issues: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/12[#12], https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2165[#2165])
* Added automatic detection of support for AES 256 bit TLS ciphers and enabled
their use when the JVM supports them.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2137[#2137]

Watcher::

* Improved error messages when there are no accounts configured for {watcher}.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2897[#2897] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2666[#2666])
* Added thread pool rejection information to execution state, which makes it
easier to debug execution failures.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2805[#2805]

* Fixed calculation of the `frequency` property value for {dfeeds} that use

information, see
{xpack-ref}/ml-configuring-aggregation.html[Aggregating Data for Faster Performance].
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/3205[#3205] (issue: https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/3204[#3204])

* Fixed REST requests that required a body but did not validate it, resulting in
null pointer exceptions.
// https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/pull/2610[#2610]

Watcher::

The following parameters can be specified in the body of a POST or PUT request:

`enabled`::
(boolean) Specifies whether the user is enabled. The default value is `true`.

`email`::
(string) The email of the user.

`full_name`::
(string) The full name of the user.

`password` (required)::
(string) The user's password. Passwords must be at least 6 characters long. 

`roles` (required)::

permissions. To create a user without any roles, specify an empty list: `[]`.


==== Authorization

To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_security` cluster privilege.


==== Examples

The following example creates a user `jacknich`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/jacknich
{
  "password" : "j@rV1s",
  "roles" : [ "admin", "other_role1" ],
  "full_name" : "Jack Nicholson",
  "email" : "jacknich@example.com",
  "metadata" : {
    "intelligence" : 7
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

A successful call returns a JSON structure that shows whether the user has been
created or updated.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "created": true <1>
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE
<1> When an existing user is updated, `created` is set to false.

After you add a user, requests from that user can be authenticated. For example:

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------
curl -u jacknich:j@rV1s http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

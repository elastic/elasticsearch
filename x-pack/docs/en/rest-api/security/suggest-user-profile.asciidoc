beta::[]

Get suggestions for user profiles that match specified search criteria.

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_security/profile/_suggest`

`POST /_security/profile/_suggest`

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

To use this API, you must have _at least_ the `read_security`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> (or a greater privilege
such as `manage_user_profile` or `manage_security`).

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-query-params]]
==== {api-query-parms-title}

`data`::
(Optional, string) Comma-separated list of filters for the `data` field of
the profile document. To return all content, use `data=*`. To return a
subset of content, use `data=<key>` to retrieve the content nested under the
specified `<key>`. Defaults to returning no content.

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`name`::
(Optional, string)
Query string used to match name-related fields in <<security-api-activate-user-profile-desc,user profile documents>>. Name-related fields are the user's `username`, `full_name` and `email`.

`size`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of profiles to return. Defaults to `10`.

`data`::
(Optional, string)
Comma-separated list of filters for the `data` field of
the profile document. It works the same way as the <<security-api-suggest-user-profile-query-params,`data` query parameter>>.

NOTE: It is an error to specify `data` as both the query parameter and the request body field.

`hint`::
(Optional, object)
Extra search criteria to improve relevance of the suggestion result.
A profile matching the specified hint is ranked higher in the response.
But not-matching the hint does not exclude a profile from the response
as long as it matches the `name` field query.
+
.Properties of `hint`:
--
`uids`::
(Optional, list of strings)
A list of Profile UIDs to match against.

`labels`::
(Optional, object)
A single key-value pair to match against the `labels` section of a profile.
The key must be a string and the value must be either a string or a list of strings.
A profile is considered matching if it matches at least one of the strings.
--

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-response-body]]
==== {api-response-body-title}


`total`::
(object)
Metadata about the number of matching profiles.

`took`::
(integer)
Milliseconds it took {es} to execute the request.

`profiles`::
(array of objects)
List of profile documents, ordered by relevance, that match the search criteria.

[[security-api-suggest-user-profile-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following request get suggestions for profile documents with name-related fields
matching `jack`. It specifies both `uids` and `labels` hints for better relevance:

[source,console]

POST /_security/profile/_suggest
{
  "name": "jack",  <1>
  "hint": {
    "uids": [  <2>
      "u_8RKO7AKfEbSiIHZkZZ2LJy2MUSDPWDr3tMI_CkIGApU_0",

    ],
    "labels": {
      "direction": ["north", "east"]  <3>
    }
  }
}
----
// TEST[setup:user_profiles]
<1> A profile's name-related fields must match `jack` for it to be included in the response.
<2> The `uids` hint include profile UIDs for both user `jackspa` and `jacknich`.
<3> The `labels` hint ranks profiles higher if their `direction` label matches either `north` or `east`.

The API returns:

}
----
// TESTRESPONSE[s/30/$body.took/]
<1> User `jacknich` is ranked highest because the profile matches both the `uids` and `labels` hints
<2> User `jackspa` is ranked second because the profile matches only the `uids` hint
<3> User `jackrea` is ranked lowest because the profile does not match any hints. However, it is *not*
    excluded from the response because it matches the `name` query.

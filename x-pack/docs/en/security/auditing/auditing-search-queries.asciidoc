=== Auditing search queries

There is no <<audit-event-types, audit event type>> specifically
dedicated to search queries. Search queries are analyzed and then processed; the
processing triggers authorization actions that are audited.
However, the original raw query, as submitted by the client, is not accessible
downstream when authorization auditing occurs.

Search queries are contained inside HTTP request bodies, however, and some
audit events that are generated by the REST layer, on the coordinating node,
can be toggled to output the request body to the audit log. Therefore, one
must audit request bodies in order to audit search queries.

To make certain audit events include the request body, edit the following
setting in the `elasticsearch.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------
xpack.security.audit.logfile.events.emit_request_body: true
----------------------------

IMPORTANT: No filtering is performed when auditing, so sensitive data might be
audited in plain text when audit events include the request body. Also, the
request body can contain malicious content that can break a parser consuming
the audit logs.

The request body is printed as an escaped JSON string value (RFC 4627) to the `request.body`
event attribute.

Not all events contain the `request.body` attribute, even when the above setting
is toggled. The ones that do are: `authentication_success`,
`authentication_failed`, `realm_authentication_failed`, `tampered_request`, `run_as_denied`,
and `anonymous_access_denied`. The `request.body` attribute is printed on the coordinating node only
(the node that handles the REST request). Most of these event types are
<<xpack-sa-lf-events-include, not included by default>>.

A good practical piece of advice is to add `authentication_success` to the event
types that are audited (add it to the list in the `xpack.security.audit.logfile.events.include`),
as this event type is not audited by default.

NOTE: Typically, the include list contains other event types as well, such as
`access_granted` or `access_denied`.

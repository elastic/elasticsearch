=== Built-in users

The {stack-security-features} provide built-in user credentials to help you get
up and running. These users have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be
authenticated until their passwords have been set. The `elastic` user can be
used to <<set-built-in-user-passwords,set all of the built-in user passwords>>.

`elastic`:: A built-in <<built-in-roles,superuser>>.
`kibana_system`:: The user Kibana uses to connect and communicate with {es}.
`logstash_system`:: The user Logstash uses when storing monitoring information in {es}.
`beats_system`:: The user the Beats use when storing monitoring information in {es}.
`apm_system`:: The user the APM server uses when storing monitoring information in {es}.
`remote_monitoring_user`:: The user {metricbeat} uses when collecting and
storing monitoring information in {es}. It has the `remote_monitoring_agent` and
`remote_monitoring_collector` built-in roles.

TIP: The built-in users serve specific purposes and are not intended for general
use. In particular, do not use the `elastic` superuser unless full access to
the cluster is required. Instead, create users that have the minimum necessary
roles or privileges for their activities.

[[built-in-user-explanation]]
==== How the built-in users work
These built-in users are stored in a special `.security` index, which is managed
by {es}. If a built-in user is disabled or its password
changes, the change is automatically reflected on each node in the cluster. If
your `.security` index is deleted or restored from a snapshot, however, any
changes you have applied are lost.

Although they share the same API, the built-in users are separate and distinct
from users managed by the <<native-realm, native realm>>. Disabling the native
realm will not have any effect on the built-in users. The built-in users can
be disabled individually, using the
<<security-api-disable-user,disable users API>>.

[[bootstrap-elastic-passwords]]
==== The Elastic bootstrap password

When you install {es}, if the `elastic` user does not already have a password,
it uses a default bootstrap password. The bootstrap password is a transient
password that enables you to run the tools that set all the built-in user passwords.

By default, the bootstrap password is derived from a randomized `keystore.seed`
setting, which is added to the keystore during installation. You do not need
to know or change this bootstrap password. If you have defined a
`bootstrap.password` setting in the keystore, however, that value is used instead.
For more information about interacting with the keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>.

NOTE: After you <<set-built-in-user-passwords,set passwords for the built-in users>>,
in particular for the `elastic` user, there is no further use for the bootstrap
password.

[[set-built-in-user-passwords]]
==== Setting built-in user passwords

You must set the passwords for all built-in users.

The +elasticsearch-setup-passwords+ tool is the simplest method to set the
built-in users' passwords for the first time. It uses the `elastic` user's
bootstrap password to run user management API requests. For example, you can run
the command in an "interactive" mode, which prompts you to enter new passwords
for the `elastic`, `kibana_system`, `logstash_system`, `beats_system`, `apm_system`,
and `remote_monitoring_user` users:

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
--------------------------------------------------

For more information about the command options, see
<<setup-passwords,elasticsearch-setup-passwords>>.

IMPORTANT: After you set a password for the `elastic` user, the bootstrap
password is no longer valid; you cannot run the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords`
command a second time.

Alternatively, you can set the initial passwords for the built-in users by using
the *Management > Users* page in {kib} or the
<<security-api-change-password,change password API>>. These methods are
more complex. You must supply the `elastic` user and its bootstrap password to
log in to {kib} or run the API. This requirement means that you cannot use the
default bootstrap password that is derived from the `keystore.seed` setting.
Instead, you must explicitly set a `bootstrap.password` setting in the keystore
before you start {es}. For example, the following command prompts you to enter a
new bootstrap password:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add "bootstrap.password"
----------------------------------------------------

You can then start {es} and {kib} and use the `elastic` user and bootstrap
password to log in to {kib} and change the passwords. Alternatively, you can
submit Change Password API requests for each built-in user. These methods are
better suited for changing your passwords after the initial setup is complete,
since at that point the bootstrap password is no longer required.

[[add-built-in-user-kibana]]
==== Adding built-in user passwords to {kib}

After the `kibana_system` user password is set, you need to update the {kib} server
with the new password by setting `elasticsearch.password` in the `kibana.yml`
configuration file:

[source,yaml]
-----------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.password: kibanapassword
-----------------------------------------------

See {kibana-ref}/using-kibana-with-security.html[Configuring security in {kib}].

[discrete]
[[add-built-in-user-logstash]]
==== Adding built-in user passwords to {ls}

The `logstash_system` user is used internally within Logstash when
monitoring is enabled for Logstash.

To enable this feature in Logstash, you need to update the Logstash
configuration with the new password by setting `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password` in
the `logstash.yml` configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: logstashpassword
----------------------------------------------------------

If you have upgraded from an older version of {es}, the `logstash_system` user
may have defaulted to _disabled_ for security reasons. Once the password has
been changed, you can enable the user via the following API call:

[source,console]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PUT _security/user/logstash_system/_enable
---------------------------------------------------------------------

See {logstash-ref}/ls-security.html#ls-monitoring-user[Configuring credentials for {ls} monitoring].

[discrete]
[[add-built-in-user-beats]]
==== Adding built-in user passwords to Beats

The `beats_system` user is used internally within Beats when monitoring is
enabled for Beats.

To enable this feature in Beats, you need to update the configuration for each
of your beats to reference the correct username and password. For example:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: beats_system
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: beatspassword
----------------------------------------------------------

For example, see {metricbeat-ref}/monitoring.html[Monitoring {metricbeat}].

The `remote_monitoring_user` is used when {metricbeat} collects and stores
monitoring data for the {stack}. See <<monitoring-production>>.

If you have upgraded from an older version of {es}, then you may not have set a
password for the `beats_system` or `remote_monitoring_user` users. If this is
the case, then you should use the *Management > Users* page in {kib} or the
<<security-api-change-password,change password API>> to set a password
for these users.

[discrete]
[[add-built-in-user-apm]]
==== Adding built-in user passwords to APM

The `apm_system` user is used internally within APM when monitoring is enabled.

To enable this feature in APM, you need to update the
{apm-server-ref}/configuring-howto-apm-server.html[APM configuration file] to
reference the correct username and password. For example:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: apm_system
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: apmserverpassword
----------------------------------------------------------

See {apm-server-ref}/monitoring.html[Monitoring APM Server].

If you have upgraded from an older version of {es}, then you may not have set a
password for the `apm_system` user. If this is the case,
then you should use the *Management > Users* page in {kib} or the
<<security-api-change-password,change password API>> to set a password
for these users.

[[disabling-default-password]]
==== Disabling default password functionality
[IMPORTANT]
=============================================================================
This setting is deprecated. The elastic user no longer has a default password.
The password must be set before the user can be used.

=== File-based user authentication

You can manage and authenticate users with the built-in `file` realm.
With the `file` realm, users are defined in local files on each node in the cluster.

IMPORTANT:  As the administrator of the cluster, it is your responsibility to
ensure the same users are defined on every node in the cluster. The {stack}
{security-features} do not deliver any mechanism to guarantee this.

The `file` realm is primarily supported to serve as a fallback/recovery realm. It
is mostly useful in situations where all users locked themselves out of the system
(no one remembers their username/password). In this type of scenarios, the `file`
realm is your only way out - you can define a new `admin` user in the `file` realm
and use it to log in and reset the credentials of all other users.

IMPORTANT: When you configure realms in `elasticsearch.yml`, only the realms you
specify are used for authentication. To use the `file` realm as a fallback, you
must include it in the realm chain.

To define users, the {security-features} provide the
<<users-command,users>> command-line tool. This tool enables you to add
and remove users, assign user roles, and manage user passwords.

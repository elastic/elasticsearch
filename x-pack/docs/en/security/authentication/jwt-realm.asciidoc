=== JWT authentication

beta::[]

{es} can be configured to trust JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that are issued as an
authentication credential from an external service.

When a JWT realm is used to authenticate with {es}, a distinction is made
between the _client_ that is connecting to {es}, and the _user_ on whose behalf
the request should run. The JWT identifies the user, and a separate credential
is used to authenticate the client.

A common scenario that uses JWTs is when an existing front-end application uses
OpenID Connect (OIDC) as an authentication method, and then accesses {es}
on behalf of the authenticated user.

TIP: If the front-end application does not exist, you can use the
<<token-authentication-services>> instead.

[[jwt-realm-oidc]]
==== JWT uses OIDC workflows
JWT authentication in {es} is derived from OIDC workflows, where different
tokens can be issued by an OIDC Provider (OP). One possible token is an
_ID token_, which uses the JWT format. If the ID token is presented to a JWT
realm, {es} can use it to authenticate, identify, and authorize an individual
user.

NOTE: Because JWTs are external to {es}, you can define a custom workflow
instead of using the OIDC workflow. However, the JWT format must still be JSON
Web Signature (JWS). The JWS header and JWS signature are validated using OIDC
ID token validation rules.

{es} supports a separate <<oidc-realm,OpenID Connect realm>>, which provides
stronger security guarantees than the JWT realm and is preferred for any
use case where {es} can act as an OIDC RP. The OIDC realm is the only supported
way to enable OIDC authentication in {kib}.

[[jwt-realm-configuration]]
==== Configure {es} to use a JWT realm

To use JWT authentication, you create the realm in the `elasticsearch.yml` file
to configure it within the {es} authentication chain.

The JWT realm has a few mandatory settings, plus optional settings that are
described in <<ref-jwt-settings,JWT realm settings>>. The following example
includes the most common settings. After defining settings, use the
{ref}/elasticsearch-keystore.html[`elasticsearch-keystore`] tool to store
values in the {es} keystore.

NOTE: The example values are not intended for every use case, and are included
only to highlight some common settings for this realm.

Client authentication is enabled by default for the JWT realms. Disabling client
authentication is possible, but strongly discouraged.

. Add your JWT realm to the `elasticsearch.yml` file:
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1:
  order: 3
  client_authentication.type: shared_secret
  allowed_issuer: "https://issuer.example.com/jwt/"
  allowed_audiences: [ "8fb85eba-979c-496c-8ae2-a57fde3f12d0" ]
  allowed_signature_algorithms: [RS256,HS256]
  pkc_jwkset_path: jwt/jwkset.json
  claims.principal: sub
----

`order`::
Specifies a realm `order` of `3`, which indicates the order in which the
configured realm is checked when authenticating a user. Realms are consulted in
ascending order, where the realm with the lowest order value is consulted first.

`client_authentication.type`::
Specifies the client authentication type as `shared_secret`, which means that
the client is authenticated using an HTTP request header that must match a
pre-configured secret value. The client must provide this shared secret with
every request in the `ES-Client-Authentication` header. The value must be a
case-insensitive match to the realm's `client_authentication.shared_secret`.

`allowed_issuer`::
Sets a verifiable identifier for your JWT issuer. This value is typically a
URL, UUID, or some other case-sensitive string value.

`allowed_audiences`::
Specifies a list of JWT audiences that the realm will allow.
These values are typically URLs, UUIDs, or other case-sensitive string values.

`allowed_signature_algorithms`::
Indicates that {es} should use the `RS256` or `HS256` signature algorithms to
verify the signature of the JWT from the JWT issuer.

`pkc_jwkset_path`::
The file path to a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) containing the public key material
that the JWT realm uses to verify JWT signatures. If a path is provided,
then it is resolved relative to the {es} configuration directory.

`claims.principal`::
The name of the JWT claim that contains the user's principal (username).

--

. Store the `shared_secret` value for `client_authentication.type`:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1.client_authentication.shared_secret
----

. Store the HMAC keys for `allowed_signature_algorithms`, which use the HMAC
SHA-256 algorithm `HS256` in the example:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add-file xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1.hmac_jwkset <path> <1>
----
<1> Path to a JWKS, which is a resource for a set of JSON-encoded secret keys.
The file can be removed after the contents are loaded into the {es} keystore setting.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the JWK Set is preferred. However, you can add an HMAC key in string format
using the following command. This format is compatible with OIDC HMAC keys, but
only supports a single key with no attributes. You can only use one HMAC format
simultaneously.

[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1.hmac_key

[[jwt-validation]]
==== JWT encoding and validation
JWTs can be parsed into three pieces:

Header::
Provides information about how to validate the token.

Claims::
Contains data about the calling user or application.

Signature::
The data that's used to validate the token.

[source,js]
----
Header: {"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}
Claims: {"aud":"aud8","sub":"security_test_user","iss":"iss8","exp":4070908800,"iat":946684800}
Signature: UnnFmsoFKfNmKMsVoDQmKI_3-j95PCaKdgqqau3jPMY
----
// NOTCONSOLE

This example illustrates a partial decoding of a JWT. The validity period is
from 2000 to 2099 (inclusive), as defined by the issue time (`iat`) and
expiration time (`exp`). JWTs typically have a validity period shorter than
100 years. The signature in this example is deterministic because the header,
claims, and HMAC key are fixed.

The supported JWT encoding is JSON Web Signature (JWS). The JWS `Header` and
`Signature` are validated using OpenID Connect ID Token validation rules. Some
validation is customizable through <<ref-jwt-settings,JWT realm settings>>.

[[jwt-validation-header]]
===== Header claims
The header claims indicate the token type and the algorithm used to sign the
token.

`alg`::
(Required, String) Indicates the algorithm that was used to sign the token, such
as `HS256`. The algorithm must be in the realm's allow list.

`typ`::
(Optional, String) Indicates the token type, which must be `JWT`.

[[jwt-validation-payload]]
===== Payload claims
OIDC ID tokens contain several claims, which provide information about the user
who is issuing the token, and the token itself.

[[jwt-validation-payload-oidc]]
====== OIDC payload claims
The following claims are validated by a subset of OIDC ID token rules.

{es} doesn't validate `nonce` claims, but a custom JWT issuer can add a
random `nonce` claim to introduce entropy into the signature.

NOTE: You can relax validation of any of the time-based claims by setting
`allowed_clock_skew`. This value sets the maximum allowed clock skew before
validating JWTs with respect to their authentication time (`auth_time`),
creation (`iat`), not before (`nbf`), and expiration times (`exp`).

`aud`::
(Required, String) Indicates the audiences that the ID token is for, expressed as a
comma-separated value (CSV). One of the values must be an exact, case-sensitive
match to any of the CSV values in the `allowed_audiences` setting.

`exp`::
(Required, integer) Expiration time for the ID token, expressed in UTC
milliseconds since epoch.

`iat`::
(Required, integer) Time that the ID token was issued, expressed in UTC
milliseconds since epoch.

`iss`::
(Required, String) Denotes the issuer that created the ID token. The value must
be an exact, case-sensitive match to the value in the `allowed_issuer` setting.

`nbf`::
(Optional, integer) Indicates the time before which the JWT must not be accepted,
expressed as UTC milliseconds since epoch.

`auth_time`::
(Optional, integer) Time when the user authenticated to the JWT issuer,
expressed as UTC milliseconds since epoch.

[[jwt-validation-payload-es]]
====== {es} settings for consuming OIDC claims
{es} uses OIDC ID token claims for the following settings.

`principal`::
(Required, String) Contains the user's principal (username). The value is
configurable using the realm setting `claims.principal`. If not set, the value
defaults to `sub`. You can configure an optional regular expression using the
`claims.principal_pattern` to extract a substring.

`groups`::
(Optional, JSON array) Contains the user's group membership.
The value is configurable using the realm setting `claims.groups`. You can
configure an optional regular expression using the realm setting
`claims.groups_pattern` to extract a substring value.

`name`::
(Optional, String) Contains a human-readable identifier that identifies the
subject of the token. The value is configurable using the realm setting
`claims.name`. You can configure an optional regular expression using the realm
setting `claims.name_pattern` to extract a substring value.

`mail`::
(Optional, String) Contains the e-mail address to associate with the user. The
value is configurable using the realm setting `claims.mail`. You can configure an
optional regular expression using the realm setting `claims.mail_pattern` to
extract a substring value.

`dn`::
(Optional, String) Contains the user's Distinguished Name (DN), which uniquely
identifies a user or group. The value is configurable using the realm setting
`claims.dn`. You can configure an optional regular expression using the realm
setting `claims.dn_pattern` to extract a substring value.

[[jwt-authorization]]
==== JWT realm authorization
The JWT realm supports authorization with the create or update role mappings API,
as well as delegating authorization to another realm.

IMPORTANT: You cannot map roles in the JWT realm using the `role_mapping.yml`
file.

===== Authorizing with the role mapping API
You can use the
<<security-api-put-role-mapping,create or update role mappings API>> to define
role mappings in the JWT realm:

[source,console]
----
PUT /_security/role_mapping/jwt1_users?refresh=true
{
  "roles" : [ "user" ],
  "rules" : { "all" : [
      { "field": { "realm.name": "jwt1" } },
      { "field": { "username": "principalname1" } },
      { "field": { "dn": "CN=Principal Name 1,DC=example.com" } },
      { "field": { "groups": "group1" } },
      { "field": { "metadata.jwt_claim_other": "other1" } }
  ] },
  "enabled": true
}
----

If you use this API in the JWT realm, the following claims are available for
role mapping:

`principal`::
(Required, String) Principal claim that is used as the {es} user's username.

`dn`::
(Optional, String) Distinguished Name (DN) that is used as the {es} user's DN.

`groups`::
(Optional, String) Comma-separated value (CSV) list that is used as the {es}
user's list of groups.

`metadata`::
(Optional, object) Additional metadata about the user, such as strings, integers,
boolean values, and collections that are used as the {es} user's metadata.
These values are key value pairs formatted as
`metadata.jwt_claim_<key>` = `<value>`.

===== Delegating JWT authorization to another realm
If you <<authorization_realms,delegate authorization>> to another realm from the
JWT realm, only the `principal` claim is available for role lookup. When
delegating the assignment and lookup of roles to another realm from the JWT
realm, claims for `dn`, `groups`, `mail`, `metadata`, and `name` are not used
for the {es} user's values. Only the JWT `principal` claim is passed to the
delegated authorization realm. The realm that is delegated for authorization
- not the JWT realm - becomes responsible for populating all of the {es} user's
values.

The following example shows how you define delegation authorization in the
`elasticsearch.yml` file to multiple other realms from the JWT realm. A JWT
realm named `jwt2` is delegating authorization to multiple realms:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt2.authorization_realms: file1,native1,ldap1,ad1
----

You can then use the
<<security-api-put-role-mapping,create or update role mappings API>> to map
roles to the authorizing realm. The following example maps roles in the `native1`
realm for the `principalname1` JWT principal.

[source,console]
----
PUT /_security/role_mapping/native1_users?refresh=true
{
  "roles" : [ "user" ],
  "rules" : { "all" : [
      { "field": { "realm.name": "native1" } },
      { "field": { "username": "principalname1" } }
  ] },
  "enabled": true
}
----

If realm `jwt2` successfully authenticates a client with a JWT for principal
`principalname1`, and delegates authorization to one of the listed realms
(such as `native1`), then that realm can look up the {es} user's values. With
this defined role mapping, the realm can also look up this role mapping rule
linked to realm `native1`.

[[hmac-oidc-example]]
==== Authorizing to the JWT realm with an OIDC HMAC key
The following settings are for a JWT issuer, {es}, and a client of {es}. The
example HMAC key is in an OIDC HMAC compatible format. The key bytes are the
UTF-8 encoding of the UNICODE characters.

IMPORTANT: HMAC UTF-8 keys need to be longer than HMAC random byte keys to
achieve the same key strength.

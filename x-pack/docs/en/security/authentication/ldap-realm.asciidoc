=== LDAP user authentication

You can configure {security} to communicate with a Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) server to authenticate users. To integrate with LDAP, you
configure an `ldap` realm and map LDAP groups to user roles in the
<<mapping-roles, role mapping file>>.

LDAP stores users and groups hierarchically, similar to the way folders are
grouped in a file system. An LDAP directory's hierarchy is built from containers
such as the _organizational unit_ (`ou`), _organization_ (`o`), and
_domain controller_ (`dc`).

The path to an entry is a _Distinguished Name_ (DN) that uniquely identifies a
user or group. User and group names typically have attributes such as a
_common name_ (`cn`) or _unique ID_ (`uid`). A DN is specified as a string,
for example  `"cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"` (white spaces are ignored).

The `ldap` realm supports two modes of operation, a user search mode
and a mode with specific templates for user DNs. 

[[ldap-user-search]]
==== User search mode and user DN templates mode

See {ref}/configuring-ldap-realm.html[Configuring an LDAP Realm].

[[ldap-load-balancing]]
==== Load balancing and failover
The `load_balance.type` setting can be used at the realm level to configure how
{security} should interact with multiple LDAP servers. {security} supports both
failover and load balancing modes of operation.

See {ref}/security-settings.html#load-balancing[Load Balancing and Failover Settings].

[[mapping-roles-ldap]]
==== Mapping LDAP groups to roles

An integral part of a realm authentication process is to resolve the roles
associated with the authenticated user. Roles define the privileges a user has
in the cluster.

Since with the `ldap` realm the users are managed externally in the LDAP server,
the expectation is that their roles are managed there as well. If fact, LDAP
supports the notion of groups, which often represent user roles for different
systems in the organization.

The `ldap` realm enables you to map LDAP users to to roles via their LDAP
groups, or other metadata. This role mapping can be configured via the
{ref}/security-api-role-mapping.html[role-mapping API], or by using a file stored
on each node. When a user authenticates with LDAP, the privileges
for that user are the union of all privileges defined by the roles to which
the user is mapped. For more information, see 
{ref}/configuring-ldap-realm.html[Configuring an LDAP Realm].

[[ldap-user-metadata]]
==== User metadata in LDAP realms
When a user is authenticated via an LDAP realm, the following properties are
populated in the user's _metadata_:

|=======================
| Field               | Description
| `ldap_dn`           | The distinguished name of the user.
| `ldap_groups`       | The distinguished name of each of the groups that were
                        resolved for the user (regardless of whether those
                        groups were mapped to a role).
|=======================

This metadata is returned in the
{ref}/security-api-authenticate.html[authenticate API], and can be used with
<<templating-role-query, templated queries>> in roles.

Additional fields can be included in the user's metadata by  configuring
the `metadata` setting on the LDAP realm. This metadata is available for use
with the <<mapping-roles-api, role mapping API>> or in
<<templating-role-query, templated role queries>>.

=== PKI user authentication

You can configure {stack} {security-features} to use Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) certificates to authenticate users in {es}. This requires clients to
present X.509 certificates.

You can use PKI certificates to authenticate users in {es} as well as {kib}.

To use PKI in {es}, you configure a PKI realm, enable client authentication on
the desired network layers (transport or http), and map the Distinguished Names
(DNs) from the user certificates to roles. You create the mappings in a
<<pki-role-mapping, role mapping file>> or use the
<<security-api-put-role-mapping,create role mappings API>>. If you want the same
users to also be authenticated using certificates when they connect to {kib},
you must configure the {es} PKI realm to
<<pki-realm-for-proxied-clients,allow delegation>> and to
{kibana-ref}/kibana-authentication.html#pki-authentication[enable PKI authentication in {kib}].

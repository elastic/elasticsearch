[[remote-clusters-privileges]]
=== Configure roles and users for remote clusters
After <<remote-clusters-connect,connecting remote clusters>>, you create a
user role on both the local and remote clusters and assign necessary privileges.
These roles are required to use {ccr} and {ccs}.

IMPORTANT: You must use the same role names on both the local
and remote clusters. For example, the following configuration for {ccr} uses the
`remote-replication` role name on both the local and remote clusters. However,
you can specify different role definitions on each cluster.

You can manage users and roles from Stack Management in {kib} by selecting
*Security > Roles* from the side navigation. You can also use the
<<security-role-mapping-apis,role management APIs>> to add, update, remove, and
retrieve roles dynamically. When you use the APIs to manage roles in the
`native` realm, the roles are stored in an internal {es} index.

The following requests use the
<<security-api-put-role,create or update roles API>>. You must have at least the
`manage_security` cluster privilege to use this API. 

[[remote-clusters-privileges-ccr]]
//tag::configure-ccr-privileges[]
==== Configure privileges for {ccr}
The {ccr} user requires different cluster and index privileges on the remote
cluster and local cluster. Use the following requests to create separate roles
on the local and remote clusters, and then create a user with the required
roles.

[discrete]
===== Remote cluster
On the remote cluster that contains the leader index, the {ccr} role requires
the `read_ccr` cluster privilege, and `monitor` and `read` privileges on the
leader index.

NOTE: If requests will be issued <<run-as-privilege,on behalf of other users>>,
then the authenticating user must have the `run_as` privilege on the remote 
cluster.

The following request creates a `remote-replication` role on the remote cluster:

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/remote-replication
{
  "cluster": [
    "read_ccr"
  ],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "leader-index-name"
      ],
      "privileges": [
        "monitor",
        "read"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

////
[source,console]
----
DELETE /_security/role/remote-replication
----
// TEST[continued]
////

[discrete]
===== Local cluster
On the local cluster that contains the follower index, the `remote-replication`
role requires the `manage_ccr` cluster privilege, and `monitor`, `read`, `write`,
and `manage_follow_index` privileges on the follower index.

The following request creates a `remote-replication` role on the local cluster:

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/remote-replication
{
  "cluster": [
    "manage_ccr"
  ],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "follower-index-name"
      ],
      "privileges": [
        "monitor",
        "read",
        "write",
        "manage_follow_index"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

After creating the `remote-replication` role on each cluster, use the 
<<security-api-put-user,create or update users API>> to create a user on
the local cluster cluster and assign the `remote-replication` role. For
example, the following request assigns the `remote-replication` role to a user
named `cross-cluster-user`:

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/user/cross-cluster-user
{
  "password" : "l0ng-r4nd0m-p@ssw0rd",
  "roles" : [ "remote-replication" ]
}
----
// TEST[continued]

NOTE: You only need to create this user on the *local* cluster.

//end::configure-ccr-privileges[]

You can then <<ccr-getting-started-tutorial,configure {ccr}>> to replicate your
data across datacenters.

[[remote-clusters-privileges-ccs]]
==== Configure privileges for {ccs}
The {ccs} user requires different cluster and index privileges on the remote
cluster and local cluster. The following requests create separate roles on the
local and remote clusters, and then create a user with the required roles.

[discrete]
===== Remote cluster
On the remote cluster, the {ccs} role requires the `read` and
`read_cross_cluster` privileges for the target indices.

NOTE: If requests will be issued <<run-as-privilege,on behalf of other users>>,
then the authenticating user must have the `run_as` privilege on the remote 
cluster.

The following request creates a `remote-search` role on the remote cluster:

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/remote-search
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "target-indices"
      ],
      "privileges": [
        "read",
        "read_cross_cluster"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

////
[source,console]
----
DELETE /_security/role/remote-search
----
// TEST[continued]
////

[discrete]
===== Local cluster
On the local cluster, which is the cluster used to initiate cross cluster
search, a user only needs the `remote-search` role. The role privileges can be
empty.

The following request creates a `remote-search` role on the local cluster:


[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/remote-search
{}
----

After creating the `remote-search` role on each cluster, use the 
<<security-api-put-user,create or update users API>> to create a user on the
local cluster and assign the `remote-search` role. For example, the following
request assigns the `remote-search` role to a user named `cross-search-user`:

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/user/cross-search-user
{
  "password" : "l0ng-r4nd0m-p@ssw0rd",
  "roles" : [ "remote-search" ]
}
----
// TEST[continued]

NOTE: You only need to create this user on the *local* cluster.

Users with the `remote-search` role can then
<<modules-cross-cluster-search,search across clusters>>.

[[clusters-privileges-ccs-kibana]]
==== Configure privileges for {ccs} and {kib}
When using {kib} to search across multiple clusters, a two-step authorization
process determines whether or not the user can access data streams and indices
on a remote cluster:

* First, the local cluster determines if the user is authorized to access remote
clusters. The local cluster is the cluster that {kib} is connected to.
* If the user is authorized, the remote cluster then determines if the user has
access to the specified data streams and indices.

To grant {kib} users access to remote clusters, assign them a local role
with read privileges to indices on the remote clusters. You specify data streams
and indices in a remote cluster as `<remote_cluster_name>:<target>`.

To grant users read access on the remote data streams and indices, you must
create a matching role on the remote clusters that grants the
`read_cross_cluster` privilege with access to the appropriate data streams and
indices.

For example, you might be actively indexing {ls} data on a local cluster and
and periodically offload older time-based indices to an archive on your remote
cluster. You want to search across both clusters, so you must enable {kib}
users on both clusters.

[discrete]
===== Local cluster
On the local cluster, create a `logstash-reader` role that grants
`read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges on the local `logstash-*` indices.

NOTE: If you configure the local cluster as another remote in {es}, the
`logstash-reader` role on your local cluster also needs to grant the
`read_cross_cluster` privilege.

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/logstash-reader
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "logstash-*"
        ],
        "privileges": [
          "read",
          "view_index_metadata"
          ]
    }
  ]
}
----

Assign your {kib} users a role that grants
{kibana-ref}/xpack-security-authorization.html[access to {kib}], as well as your
`logstash_reader` role. For example, the following request creates the
`cross-cluster-kibana` user and assigns the `kibana-access` and
`logstash-reader` roles.

[source,console]
----
PUT /_security/user/cross-cluster-kibana
{
  "password" : "l0ng-r4nd0m-p@ssw0rd",
  "roles" : [ 
    "logstash-reader",
    "kibana-access"
    ]
}
----

[discrete]
===== Remote cluster
On the remote cluster, create a `logstash-reader` role that grants the
`read_cross_cluster` privilege and `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges
for the `logstash-*` indices.

[source,console]
----
POST /_security/role/logstash-reader
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "logstash-*"
        ],
        "privileges": [
          "read_cross_cluster",
          "read",
          "view_index_metadata"
          ]
    }
  ]
}

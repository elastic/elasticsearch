=== Built-in roles

The {stack-security-features} apply a default role to all users, including
<<anonymous-access, anonymous users>>. The default role enables users to access
the authenticate endpoint, change their own passwords, and get information about
themselves.

There is also a set of built-in roles you can explicitly assign to users. These
roles have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be updated.

[[built-in-roles-apm-system]] `apm_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the APM system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}.

[[built-in-roles-apm-user]] `apm_user` ::
Grants the privileges required for APM users (such as `read` and 
`view_index_metadata` privileges on the `apm-*` and `.ml-anomalies*` indices).

[[built-in-roles-beats-admin]] `beats_admin` ::
Grants access to the `.management-beats` index, which contains configuration
information for the Beats.

[[built-in-roles-beats-system]] `beats_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the Beats system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}.
+
--
[NOTE] 
===============================
* This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.
* This role does not provide access to the beats indices and is not
suitable for writing beats output to {es}.

Grants `manage_data_frame_transforms` cluster privileges, which enable you to
manage {transforms}. This role also includes all
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

{kib} indices, manage index templates and tokens, and check the availability of
the {es} cluster. This role grants read access to the `.monitoring-*` indices
and read and write access to the `.reporting-*` indices. For more information,
see {kibana-ref}/using-kibana-with-security.html[Configuring Security in {kib}].

===============================
* This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.
* This role does not provide access to the logstash indices and is not
suitable for use within a Logstash pipeline.

[[built-in-roles-ml-admin]] `machine_learning_admin`::
Grants `manage_ml` cluster privileges, read access to `.ml-anomalies*`,
`.ml-notifications*`, `.ml-state*`, `.ml-meta*` indices and write access to
`.ml-annotations*` indices. This role also includes all
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

[[built-in-roles-ml-user]] `machine_learning_user`::
Grants the minimum privileges required to view {ml} configuration,
status, and work with results. This role grants `monitor_ml` cluster privileges,
read access to the `.ml-notifications` and `.ml-anomalies*` indices
(which store {ml} results), and write access to `.ml-annotations*` indices.
This role also includes all {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

[[built-in-roles-monitoring-user]] `monitoring_user`::
Grants the minimum privileges required for any user of {monitoring} other than those
required to use {kib}. This role grants access to the monitoring indices and grants
privileges necessary for reading basic cluster information. This role also includes
all {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {stack-monitor-features}.
Monitoring users should also be assigned the `kibana_admin` role, or another role
with {kibana-ref}/xpack-security-authorization.html[access to the {kib} instance].

[[built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent]] `remote_monitoring_agent`::
Grants the minimum privileges required to write data into the monitoring indices
(`.monitoring-*`). This role also has the privileges necessary to create 
{metricbeat} indices (`metricbeat-*`) and write data into them. 

[[built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-collector]] `remote_monitoring_collector`::
Grants the minimum privileges required to collect monitoring data for the {stack}.

[[built-in-roles-reporting-user]] `reporting_user`::
Grants the specific privileges required for users of {reporting} other than those
required to use {kib}. This role grants access to the reporting indices; each 
user has access to only their own reports.
Reporting users should also be assigned additional roles that grant 
{kibana-ref}/xpack-security-authorization.html[access to {kib}] as well as read
access to the <<roles-indices-priv,indices>> that will be used to generate reports.

[[built-in-roles-snapshot-user]] `snapshot_user`::
Grants the necessary privileges to create snapshots of **all** the indices and
to view their metadata. This role enables users to view the configuration of
existing snapshot repositories and snapshot details. It does not grant authority
to remove or add repositories or to restore snapshots. It also does not enable
to change index settings or to read or update index data.

[[built-in-roles-superuser]] `superuser`::
Grants full access to the cluster, including all indices and data. A user with
the `superuser` role can also manage users and roles and
<<run-as-privilege, impersonate>> any other user in the system. Due to the
permissive nature of this role, take extra care when assigning it to a user.

[[built-in-roles-transform-admin]] `transform_admin`:: 
Grants `manage_transform` cluster privileges, which enable you to manage 
{transforms}. This role also includes all 
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

[[built-in-roles-transform-user]] `transform_user`::
Grants `monitor_transform` cluster privileges, which enable you to use 
{transforms}. This role also includes all
{kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges] for the {ml-features}.

[[built-in-roles-transport-client]] `transport_client`::
Grants the privileges required to access the cluster through the Java Transport
Client. The Java Transport Client fetches information about the nodes in the
cluster using the _Node Liveness API_ and the _Cluster State API_ (when
sniffing is enabled). Assign your users this role if they use the
Transport Client.
+
NOTE: Using the Transport Client effectively means the users are granted access
to the cluster state. This means users can view the metadata over all indices,
index templates, mappings, node and basically everything about the cluster.
However, this role does not grant permission to view the data in all indices.

[[built-in-roles-watcher-admin]] `watcher_admin`::
+
Grants read access to the `.watches` index, read access to the watch history and
the triggered watches index and allows to execute all watcher actions.

[[built-in-roles-watcher-user]] `watcher_user`::
+
Grants read access to the `.watches` index, the get watch action and the watcher
stats.

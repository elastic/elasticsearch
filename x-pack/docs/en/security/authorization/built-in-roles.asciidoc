=== Built-in roles

{security} applies a default role to all users, including
<<anonymous-access, anonymous users>>. The default role enables users to access
the authenticate endpoint, change their own passwords, and get information about
themselves.

{security} also provides a set of built-in roles you can explicitly assign
to users. These roles have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be updated.

[[built-in-roles-ingest-user]] `ingest_admin` ::
Grants access to manage *all* index templates and *all* ingest pipeline configurations.
+
NOTE: This role does *not* provide the ability to create indices; those privileges
must be defined in a separate role.

[[built-in-roles-kibana-dashboard]] `kibana_dashboard_only_user` ::
Grants access to the {kib} Dashboard and read-only permissions on the `.kibana`
index. This role does not have access to editing tools in {kib}. For more
information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-dashboard-only-mode.html[{kib} Dashboard Only Mode].

[[built-in-roles-kibana-system]] `kibana_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the {kib} system user to read from and write to the
{kib} indices, manage index templates, and check the availability of the {es} cluster.
This role grants read access to the `.monitoring-*` indices and read and write access
to the `.reporting-*` indices. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/using-kibana-with-security.html[Configuring Security in {kib}].
+
NOTE: This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.

[[built-in-roles-kibana-user]] `kibana_user`::
Grants the minimum privileges required for any user of {kib}. This role grants
access to the {kib} indices and grants  monitoring privileges for the cluster.

[[built-in-roles-logstash-admin]] `logstash_admin` ::
Grants access to the `.logstash*` indices for managing configurations.

[[built-in-roles-logstash-system]] `logstash_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the Logstash system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}. For more information, see
{logstash-ref}/ls-security.html[Configuring Security in Logstash].
+
NOTE: This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.
+
NOTE: This role does not provide access to the logstash indices and is not
suitable for use within a Logstash pipeline.

[[built-in-roles-beats-system]] `beats_system` ::
Grants access necessary for the Beats system user to send system-level data
(such as monitoring) to {es}.
+
NOTE: This role should not be assigned to users as the granted permissions may
change between releases.
+
NOTE: This role does not provide access to the beats indices and is not
suitable for writing beats output to {es}.

[[built-in-roles-ml-admin]] `machine_learning_admin`::
Grants `manage_ml` cluster privileges and read access to the `.ml-*` indices.

[[built-in-roles-ml-user]] `machine_learning_user`::
Grants the minimum privileges required to view {xpackml} configuration,
status, and results. This role grants `monitor_ml` cluster privileges and
read access to the `.ml-notifications` and `.ml-anomalies*` indices,
which store {ml} results.

[[built-in-roles-monitoring-user]] `monitoring_user`::
Grants the minimum privileges required for any user of {monitoring} other than those
required to use {kib}. This role grants access to the monitoring indices and grants
privileges necessary for reading basic cluster information. Monitoring users should
also be assigned the `kibana_user` role.

[[built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent]] `remote_monitoring_agent`::
Grants the minimum privileges required for a remote monitoring agent to write data
into this cluster.

[[built-in-roles-reporting-user]] `reporting_user`::
Grants the specific privileges required for users of {reporting} other than those
required to use {kib}. This role grants access to the reporting indices. Reporting
users should also be assigned the `kibana_user` role and a role that grants them
access to the data that will be used to generate reports with.

[[built-in-roles-superuser]] `superuser`::
Grants full access to the cluster, including all indices and data. A user with
the `superuser` role can also manage users and roles and
<<run-as-privilege, impersonate>> any other user in the system. Due to the
permissive nature of this role, take extra care when assigning it to a user.

[[built-in-roles-transport-client]] `transport_client`::
Grants the privileges required to access the cluster through the Java Transport
Client. The Java Transport Client fetches information about the nodes in the
cluster using the _Node Liveness API_ and the _Cluster State API_ (when
sniffing is enabled). Assign your users this role if they use the
Transport Client.
+
NOTE: Using the Transport Client effectively means the users are granted access
to the cluster state. This means users can view the metadata over all indices,
index templates, mappings, node and basically everything about the cluster.
However, this role does not grant permission to view the data in all indices.

[[built-in-roles-watcher-admin]] `watcher_admin`::
+
Grants write access to the `.watches` index, read access to the watch history and
the triggered watches index and allows to execute all watcher actions.

[[built-in-roles-watcher-user]] `watcher_user`::
+
Grants read access to the `.watches` index, the get watch action and the watcher
stats.

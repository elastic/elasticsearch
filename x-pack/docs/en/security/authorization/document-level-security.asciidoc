=== Document level security

Document level security restricts the documents that users have read access to.
In particular, it restricts which documents can be accessed from document-based 
read APIs. 

To enable document level security, you use a query to specify the documents that 
each role can access. The document query is associated with a particular index 
or index pattern and operates in conjunction with the privileges specified for 
the indices.

The following role definition grants read access only to documents that
belong to the `click` category within all the `events-*` indices:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_security/role/click_role
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [ "events-*" ],
      "privileges": [ "read" ],
      "query": "{\"match\": {\"category\": \"click\"}}"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Omitting the `query` entry entirely disables document level security for
      the respective indices permission entry.

The specified `query` expects the same format as if it was defined in the
search request and supports the full {es} <<query-dsl,query DSL>>.

For example, the following role grants read access only to the documents whose
`department_id` equals `12`:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_security/role/dept_role
{
  "indices" : [
    {
      "names" : [ "*" ],
      "privileges" : [ "read" ],
      "query" : {
        "term" : { "department_id" : 12 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: `query` also accepts queries written as string values.

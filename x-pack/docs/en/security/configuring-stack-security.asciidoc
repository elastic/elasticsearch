[[configuring-stack-security]]
== Start the Elastic Stack with security enabled

beta::[This functionality is in alpha and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Alpha features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.]

Before you start {es} for the first time, run the `elasticsearch-security-config`
tool. This tool generates certificates and keys for the transport and HTTP
layers of {es}, and writes the TLS configuration settings to `elasticsearch.yml`.

[discrete]
=== Prerequisites

Download the `elasticsearch 8.0.0-alpha1` package distribution for your
environment.

[discrete]
=== Start {es} with security enabled

. Before starting {es} for the first time, run the
`elasticsearch-security-config` tool from the directory where you downloaded
the {es} package distribution:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-security-config
----
+
The `elasticsearch-security-config` tool generates the following security
certificates and keys in `$ES_PATH_CONF/auto_config_on_<timestamp>`:
+
--
`http_ca.crt`::
The CA certificate that is used to sign the certificates for the HTTP layer of
this {es} cluster.

`http_keystore_local_node.p12`::
Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the HTTP layer for the this node.

`transport_keystore_all_nodes.p12`::
Keystore that contains the key and certificate for the transport layer for all the nodes in your cluster.
--
+
NOTE: The `ES_PATH_CONF` variable is the path for the {es}
configuration files. If you installed {es} using archive distributions
(`zip` or `tar.gz`), the variable defaults to `ES_HOME/config`. If you used
package distributions (Debian or RPM), the variable defaults to
`/etc/elasticsearch`.

. Start {es}.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch
----

. In another terminal window, run the
<<setup-passwords,`elasticsearch-setup-passwords`>> utility from the directory
where you downloaded the {es} package distribution:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
----
+
If you want to use your own passwords, run the command with the
`interactive` parameter instead of the `auto` parameter. Using this mode
steps you through password configuration for all of the built-in users.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
----

. Save the generated passwords. You'll need them to add the built-in user to
{kib}.
+
NOTE: After you set a password for the `elastic` user, you cannot run the
`elasticsearch-setup-passwords` command a second time. If you forgot the
password for the `elastic` user or want to change it, use the
<<reset-elastic-password,`elasticsearch-reset-elastic-password`>> tool.

. Make an authenticated call to your {es} cluster and enter the password for
the `elastic` user when prompted:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl --cacert $ES_PATH_CONF/auto_config_on_<timestamp>/http_ca.crt \
-u elastic https://localhost:9200
----
// NOTCONSOLE
+
`--cacert`::
Path to the generated `http_ca.crt` certificate for the HTTP layer.

*Next*: <<add-kib-user,Configure {kib} to connect to {es} with a password>>

[discrete]
[[add-kib-user]]
=== Configure {kib} to connect to {es} with a password

With security enabled, users must log in to {kib} with a valid username and
password.

You'll configure {kib} to use the built-in `kibana_system` user and the password
that you created earlier. {kib} performs some background tasks that require use
of the `kibana_system` user.

This account is not meant for individual users and does not have permission to
log in to {kib} from a browser. Instead, you'll log in to {kib} as the `elastic`
superuser. 

. Add the `elasticsearch.username` setting to the `$KBN_PATH_CONF/kibana.yml`
file and set the value to the `kibana_system` user:
+
[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
----
+
NOTE: The `$KBN_PATH_CONF` variable is the path for the {kib}
configuration files. If you installed {kib} using archive distributions
(`zip` or `tar.gz`), the variable defaults to `$KBN_HOME/config`. If you used
package distributions (Debian or RPM), the variable defaults to `/etc/kibana`.

. From the directory where you installed {kib}, run the following commands
to create the {kib} keystore and add the secure settings:

   a. Create the {kib} keystore:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/kibana-keystore create
----

   b. Add the password for the `kibana_system` user to the {kib} keystore:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/kibana-keystore add elasticsearch.password
----
+
When prompted, enter the password for the `kibana_system` user.

. Restart {kib}. For example, if you installed {kib} with a `.tar.gz` package, run the following command from the {kib} directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/kibana
----

. Log in to {kib} as the `elastic` user. Use this superuser account to 
{kibana-ref}/tutorial-secure-access-to-kibana.html[manage spaces, create new users, and assign roles]. If you're running {kib} locally, go to `http://localhost:5601` to view the login page.

*Next*: <<encrypt-kibana-with-elasticsearch,Encrypt traffic between {kib} and {es}>>

[discrete]
[[encrypt-kibana-with-elasticsearch]]
=== Encrypt traffic between {kib} and {es}

When you ran the `elasticsearch-security-config` tool, it
created an `http_ca.crt` file in `$ES_PATH_CONF/auto_config_on_<timestamp>`.
Use this file to configure {kib} to trust the {es} CA for the HTTP layer.

1. Copy the `http_ca.crt` file to the {kib} configuration directory, as defined
by the `$KBN_PATH_CONF` path.

2. Open `kibana.yml` and add the following line to specify the location of the
security certificate for the HTTP layer.
+
[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: $KBN_PATH_CONF/http_ca.crt
----

3. Add the following line to specify the HTTPS URL for your {es}
cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.hosts: https://<your_elasticsearch_host>.com:9200
----

4. Restart {kib}. You can now connect to {kib} securely over HTTPS, such as
`https://localhost:5601`.

.Connect to a secure monitoring cluster
****
If the Elastic monitoring features are enabled and you configured a separate
{es} monitoring cluster, you can also configure {kib} to connect to
the monitoring cluster via HTTPS. The steps are the same, but each setting is
prefixed by `monitoring`. For example, `monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.hosts` and
`monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`.

NOTE: You must create a separate `elasticsearch-ca.pem` security file for the
monitoring cluster.

=== FIPS 140-2

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB
140-2), titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S.
government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules.
{es} offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a FIPS 140-2
configured JVM.

IMPORTANT: The JVM bundled with {es} is not configured for FIPS 140-2. You must 
configure an external JDK with a FIPS 140-2 certified Java Security Provider.
Refer to the {es}
https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[JVM support matrix] for
supported JVM configurations.

After configuring your JVM for FIPS 140-2, you can run {es} in FIPS 140-2 mode by
setting the `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled` to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`.

For {es}, adherence to FIPS 140-2 is ensured by:

- Using FIPS approved / NIST recommended cryptographic algorithms.
- Delegating the implementation of these cryptographic algorithms to a NIST
  validated cryptographic module (available via the Java Security Provider
  in use in the JVM).
- Allowing the configuration of {es} in a FIPS 140-2 compliant manner, as
  documented below.

=== Upgrade considerations

[IMPORTANT]
====

====


If you plan to upgrade your existing cluster to a version that can be run in
a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM, we recommend to first perform a rolling
upgrade to the new version in your existing JVM and perform all necessary
configuration changes in preparation for running in FIPS 140-2 mode. You can then
perform a rolling restart of the nodes, starting each node in a FIPS 140-2 JVM.
During the restart, {es}:

- Upgrades <<secure-settings,secure settings>> to the latest, compliant format.
  A FIPS 140-2 JVM cannot load previous format versions. If your keystore is
  not password-protected, you must manually set a password. See
  <<keystore-fips-password>>.
- Upgrades self-generated trial licenses to the latest FIPS 140-2 compliant format.

If your {subscriptions}[subscription] already supports FIPS 140-2 mode, you
can elect to perform a rolling upgrade while at the same time running each
upgraded node in a FIPS 140-2 JVM. In this case, you would need to also manually
regenerate your `elasticsearch.keystore` and migrate all secure settings to it,
in addition to the necessary configuration changes outlined below, before
starting each node.

=== Configuring {es} for FIPS 140-2

Apart from setting `xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled`, a number of security
related settings need to be configured accordingly in order to be compliant
and able to run {es} successfully in a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM.

[discrete]
[[keystore-fips-password]]
==== {es} Keystore

FIPS 140-2 (via NIST Special Publication 800-132) dictates that encryption keys should at
least have an effective strength of 112 bits.
As such, the {es} keystore that stores the node's <<secure-settings,secure settings>>
needs to be password protected with a password that satisfies this requirement.
This means that the password needs to be 14 bytes long which is equivalent
to a 14 character ASCII encoded password, or a 7 character UTF-8 encoded password.
You can use the <<elasticsearch-keystore, elasticsearch-keystore passwd>> subcommand to change or set the
password of an existing keystore.
Note that when the keystore is password-protected, you must supply the password each time
Elasticsearch starts.

[discrete]
==== TLS

SSLv2 and SSLv3 are not allowed by FIPS 140-2, so `SSLv2Hello` and `SSLv3` cannot
be used for <<ssl-tls-settings,`ssl.supported_protocols`>>.

NOTE: The use of TLS ciphers is mainly governed by the relevant crypto module
(the FIPS Approved Security Provider that your JVM uses). All the ciphers that
are configured by default in {es} are FIPS 140-2 compliant and as such can be
used in a FIPS 140-2 JVM. See <<ssl-tls-settings,`ssl.cipher_suites`>>.

[discrete]
==== TLS keystores and keys

Keystores can be used in a number of <<ssl-tls-settings>> in order to
conveniently store key and trust material. Neither `JKS`, nor `PKCS#12` keystores
can be used in a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM. Avoid using
these types of keystores. Your FIPS 140-2 provider may provide a compliant keystore
implementation that can be used, or you can use PEM encoded files. To use PEM encoded
key material, you can use the relevant `\*.key` and `*.certificate` configuration
options, and for trust material you can use `*.certificate_authorities`.


FIPS 140-2 compliance dictates that the length of the public keys used for TLS
must correspond to the strength of the symmetric key algorithm in use in TLS.
Depending on the value of `ssl.cipher_suites` that you select to use, the TLS
keys must have corresponding length according to the following table:

[[comparable-key-strength]]
.Comparable key strengths
|=======================
| Symmetric Key Algorithm | RSA key Length | ECC key length
| `3DES`                  | 2048           | 224-255
| `AES-128`               | 3072           | 256-383
| `AES-256`               | 15630          | 512+
|=======================

==== Stored password hashing
[[fips-stored-password-hashing]]

While {es} offers a number of algorithms for securely hashing credentials
on disk, only the `PBKDF2` based family of algorithms is compliant with FIPS
140-2 for stored password hashing. However, since `PBKDF2` is essentially a key derivation
function, your JVM security provider may enforce a
<<keystore-fips-password,112-bit key strength requirement>>. Although FIPS 140-2
does not mandate user password standards, this requirement may affect password
hashing in {es}. To comply with this requirement,
while allowing you to use passwords that satisfy your security policy, {es} offers
<<hashing-settings, pbkdf2_stretch>> which is the suggested hashing algorithm when running
{es} in FIPS 140-2 environments. `pbkdf2_stretch` performs a single round of SHA-512
on the user password before passing it to the `PBKDF2` implementation.

NOTE: You can still use one of the plain `pbkdf2` options instead of `pbkdf2_stretch` if
you have external policies and tools that can ensure all user passwords for the reserved,
native, and file realms are longer than 14 bytes.

You must set the `xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm` setting to one of the
available `pbkdf_stretch_*` values.
When FIPS-140 mode is enabled, the default value for
`xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm` is `pbkdf2_stretch`.
See <<hashing-settings>>.

Password hashing configuration changes are not retroactive so the stored hashed
credentials of existing users of the reserved, native, and file realms are not
updated on disk.
To ensure FIPS 140-2 compliance, recreate users or
change their password using the <<users-command, elasticsearch-user>> CLI tool
for the file realm and the <<security-api-put-user,create users>> and
<<security-api-change-password,change password>> APIs for the native and reserved realms.
Other types of realms are not affected and do not require any changes.

[discrete]
==== Cached password hashing
[[fips-cached-password-hashing]]

`ssha256` (salted `sha256`) is recommended for cache hashing. Though
`PBKDF2` is compliant with FIPS-140-2, it is -- by design -- slow, and
thus not generally suitable as a cache hashing algorithm. Cached
credentials are never stored on disk, and salted `sha256` provides an
adequate level of security for in-memory credential hashing, without
imposing prohibitive performance overhead. You _may_ use `PBKDF2`,
however you should carefully assess performance impact first. Depending
on your deployment, the overhead of `PBKDF2` could undo most of the
performance gain of using a cache.

Either set all `cache.hash_algo` settings to `ssha256` or leave
them undefined, since `ssha256` is the default value for all
`cache.hash_algo` settings. See <<hashing-settings>>.

The user cache will be emptied upon node restart, so any existing
hashes using non-compliant algorithms will be discarded and the new
ones will be created using the algorithm you have selected.

[discrete]
=== Limitations

Due to the limitations that FIPS 140-2 compliance enforces, a small number of
features are not available while running in FIPS 140-2 mode. The list is as follows:

* Azure Classic Discovery Plugin
* The <<certutil,`elasticsearch-certutil`>> tool. However,
 `elasticsearch-certutil` can very well be used in a non FIPS 140-2
  configured JVM (pointing `ES_JAVA_HOME` environment variable to a different
  java installation) in order to generate the keys and certificates that
  can be later used in the FIPS 140-2 configured JVM.
* The SQL CLI client cannot run in a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM while using
  TLS for transport security or PKI for client authentication.

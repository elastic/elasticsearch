When you use the basic and trial licenses, the {es} {security-features} are
disabled by default. To enable them:

. Stop {kib}. The method for starting and stopping {kib} varies depending on 
how you installed it. For example, if you installed {kib} from an archive 
distribution (`.tar.gz` or `.zip`), stop it by entering `Ctrl-C` on the command 
line. See {kibana-ref}/start-stop.html[Starting and stopping {kib}]. 

. Stop {es}. For example, if you installed {es} from an archive distribution, 
enter `Ctrl-C` on the command line. See 
<<stopping-elasticsearch>>.

. Add the `xpack.security.enabled` setting to the 
`ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file.

TIP: The `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable contains the path for the {es} 
configuration files. If you installed {es} using archive distributions (`zip` or 
`tar.gz`), it defaults to `ES_HOME/config`. If you used package distributions 
(Debian or RPM), it defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`. For more information, see 
<<settings>>.  

For example, add the following setting:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.enabled: true
----

TIP: If you have a basic or trial license, the default value for this setting is 
`false`. If you have a gold or higher license, the default value is `true`. 
Therefore, it is a good idea to explicitly add this setting to avoid confusion 
about whether {security-features} are enabled.

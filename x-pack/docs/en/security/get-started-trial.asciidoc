By default, when you install {stack} products, they apply basic licenses with no 
expiration dates. To view your license in {kib}, go to **Management** and click 
**License Management**.

For more information about Elastic license levels, see 
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.

You can start a 30-day trial to try out all of the platinum features, including 
{security} and {ml}. Click **Start trial** on the **License Management** page in 
{kib}.

IMPORTANT: If your cluster has already activated a trial license for the current 
major version, you cannot start a new trial. For example, if you have already 
activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new trial until v7.0.

At the end of the trial period, the platinum features operate in a 
<<license-expiration,degraded mode>>. You can revert to a basic license, extend 
the trial, or purchase a subscription.

=== Set up basic security for the Elastic Stack plus secured HTTPS traffic
++++
<titleabbrev>Set up basic security plus HTTPS</titleabbrev>
++++

In a production environment, some {es} features such as tokens and
API keys will be disabled unless you enable TLS on the HTTP layer. This
additional layer of security ensures that all communications to and from your
cluster are secured.

When you run the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool in `http` mode, the tool asks
several questions about how you want to generate certificates. While there are
numerous options, the following choices result in certificates that should
work for most environments.

[[signing-certificates]]
.Signing certificates
****
The first question that the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool prompts you with is
whether you want to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). Answer
`n` if you want to sign your own certificates, or `y` if you want to sign
certificates with a central CA.

[discrete]
===== Sign your own certificates

If you want to use the CA that you created when
<<generate-certificates,Generating the certificate authority>> answer `n` when
asked if you want to generate a CSR. You then specify the location of your CA,
which the tool uses to sign and generate a `.p12` certificate. The steps in
this procedure follow this workflow.

[discrete]
===== Sign certificates with a central CA

If you work in an environment with a central security team, they can likely
generate a certificate for you. Infrastructure within your organization
might already be configured to trust an existing CA, so it may be easier
for clients to connect to {es} if you use a CSR and send that
request to the team that controls your CA. To use a central CA, answer `y` to
the first question.

[[basic-setup-https-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

Complete all steps in <<security-basic-setup,Set up basic security for the Elastic Stack>>.

[[encrypt-http-communication]]
==== Encrypt HTTP client communications for {es}

. On *every* node in your cluster, stop {es} and {kib} if they are running.

. On any single node, from the directory where you installed {es}, run the {es}
   HTTP certificate tool to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil http
----
+
This command generates a `.zip` file that contains certificates and keys
to use with {es} and {kib}. Each folder contains a `README.txt`
explaining how to use these files.

   a. When asked if you want to generate a CSR, enter `n`.

   b. When asked if you want to use an existing CA, enter `y`.

   c. Enter the path to your CA. This is the absolute path to
   the `elastic-stack-ca.p12` file that you generated for your cluster.

   d. Enter the password for your CA.

   e. Enter an expiration value for your certificate. You can enter the
   validity period in years, months, or days. For example, enter `90D` for 90
   days.

   f. When asked if you want to generate one certificate per node, enter `y`.
+
Each certificate will have its own private key, and will be issued for a
specific hostname or IP address.

   g. When prompted, enter the name of the first node in your cluster. Use the same node name that you used when <<generate-certificates,generating node certificates>>.

   h. Enter all hostnames used to connect to your first node. These hostnames
   will be added as DNS names in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in your certificate.
+
List every hostname and variant used to connect to your cluster over HTTPS.

   i. Enter the IP addresses that clients can use to connect to your node.

   j. Repeat these steps for each additional node in your cluster.

. After generating a certificate for each of your nodes, enter a password for
   your private key when prompted.

. Unzip the generated `elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip` file. This compressed file
   contains one directory for both {es} and {kib}.
+
--
[source,txt]
----
/elasticsearch
|_ README.txt
|_ http.p12
|_ sample-elasticsearch.yml
----

[source,txt]
----
/kibana
|_ README.txt
|_ elasticsearch-ca.pem
|_ sample-kibana.yml
----
--

. On *every* node in your cluster, complete the following steps:

  .. Copy the relevant `http.p12` certificate to the `$ES_PATH_CONF` directory.

  .. Edit the `elasticsearch.yml` file to enable HTTPS security and specify the
  location of the `http.p12` security certificate.
+
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path: http.p12
----

  .. Add the password for your private key to the secure settings in {es}.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.secure_password
----

  .. Start {es}.

**Next**: <<encrypt-kibana-http,Encrypt HTTP client communications for {kib}>>

[[encrypt-kibana-http]]
==== Encrypt HTTP client communications for {kib}

Browsers send traffic to {kib} and {kib} sends traffic to {es}.
These communication channels are configured separately to use TLS. You encrypt
traffic between your browser and {kib}, and then encrypt traffic between
{kib} and {es}.

[[encrypt-kibana-elasticsearch]]
===== Encrypt traffic between {kib} and {es}

When you ran the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool with the `http` option, it
created a `/kibana` directory containing an `elasticsearch-ca.pem` file. You
use this file to configure {kib} to trust the {es} CA for the HTTP
layer.

. Copy the `elasticsearch-ca.pem` file to the {kib} configuration directory,
as defined by the `$KBN_PATH_CONF` path.

. Open `kibana.yml` and add the following line to specify the location of the
security certificate for the HTTP layer.
+
[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: $KBN_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch-ca.pem
----

. Add the following line to specify the HTTPS URL for your {es}
cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----
elasticsearch.hosts: https://<your_elasticsearch_host>.com:9200
----

. Restart {kib}.

.Connect to a secure monitoring cluster
****
If the Elastic monitoring features are enabled and you configured a separate
{es} monitoring cluster, you can also configure {kib} to connect to
the monitoring cluster via HTTPS. The steps are the same, but each setting is
prefixed by `monitoring`. For example, `monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.hosts` and
`monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path`.

NOTE: You must create a separate `elasticsearch-ca.pem` security file for the
monitoring cluster.
****

**Next**: <<encrypt-kibana-browser,Encrypt traffic between your browser and {kib}>>

[[encrypt-kibana-browser]]
===== Encrypt traffic between your browser and {kib}

You create a server certificate and private key for {kib}. {kib} uses this
server certificate and corresponding private key when receiving connections
from web browsers.

When you obtain a server certificate, you must set its subject alternative
name (SAN) correctly to ensure that browsers will trust it. You can set one or
more SANs to the {kib} server’s fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), hostname,
or IP address. When choosing the SAN, pick whichever attribute you'll use to
connect to {kib} in your browser, which is likely the FQDN.

The following instructions create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for {kib}.
A CSR contains information that a CA uses to generate and sign a security
certificate. The certificate can be trusted (signed by a public, trusted CA)
or untrusted (signed by an internal CA). A self-signed or internally-signed
certificate is acceptable for development environments and building a proof of
concept, but should not be used in a production environment.

WARNING: Before going to production, use a trusted CA such as https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's
Encrypt] or your organization's internal CA to sign the certificate. Using a
signed certificate establishes browser trust for connections to {kib} for
internal access or on the public internet.

. Generate a server certificate and private key for {kib}.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil csr -name kibana-server -dns example.com,www.example.com
----
+
The CSR has a common name (CN) of `kibana-server`, a SAN of `example.com`,
and another SAN of `www.example.com`.
+
This command generates a `csr-bundle.zip` file by default with the following
contents:
+
[source,txt]
----
/kibana-server
|_ kibana-server.csr
|_ kibana-server.key
----

. Unzip the `csr-bundle.zip` file to obtain the `kibana-server.csr` unsigned
security certificate and the `kibana-server.key` unencrypted private key.

. Send the `kibana-server.csr` certificate signing request to your internal
CA or trusted CA for signing to obtain a signed certificate. The signed file
can be in different formats, such as a `.crt` file like `kibana-server.crt`.

. Open `kibana.yml` and add the following lines to configure {kib} to access
the server certificate and unencrypted private key.
+
[source,yaml]
----
server.ssl.certificate: $KBN_PATH_CONF/kibana-server.crt
server.ssl.key: $KBN_PATH_CONF/kibana-server.key
----
+
NOTE: `$KBN_PATH_CONF` contains the path for the {kib} configuration files. If
you installed {kib} using archive distributions (`zip` or `tar.gz`), the
path defaults to `$KBN_HOME/config`. If you used package distributions
(Debian or RPM), the path defaults to `/etc/kibana`.

. Add the following line to `kibana.yml` to enable TLS for inbound
connections.
+
[source,yaml]
----
server.ssl.enabled: true
----

. Start {kib}.

NOTE: After making these changes, you must always access {kib} via HTTPS. For
example, `https://<your_kibana_host>.com`.

**Next**: <<configure-beats-security,Configure {beats} security>>

[[configure-beats-security]]
==== Configure {beats} security

The {beats} are open source data shippers that you install as agents on your
servers to send operational data to {es}. Each Beat is a separately
installable product. The following steps cover configuring security for
{metricbeat}. Follow these steps for each https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/7.9/get-started-elastic-stack.html#install-beats[additonal Beat] you want to configure security for.

===== Prerequisites

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/7.9/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html[Install {metricbeat}] using your preferred method.

NOTE: You cannot connect to the Elastic Stack or set up assets for {metricbeat}
before completing the following steps.

===== Create roles for {metricbeat}
Typically, you need to create the following separate roles:

- **setup** role for setting up index templates and other dependencies
- **monitoring** role for sending monitoring information
- **writer** role for publishing events collected by Metricbeat
- **reader** role for Kibana users who need to view and create visualizations that access Metricbeat data

NOTE: These instructions assume that you are using the default name for
{metricbeat} indices. If the indicated index names are not listed, or you are
using a custom name, enter it manually when defining roles and modify the
privileges to match your index naming pattern.

To create users and roles from Stack Management in {kib}, select **Roles**
or **Users** from the side navigation.

**Next**: <<beats-setup-role,Create a setup role>>

[discrete]
[[beats-setup-role]]
====== Create a setup role and user

Administrators who set up {metricbeat} typically need to load mappings,
dashboards, and other objects used to index data into {es} and visualize it in
{kib}.

WARNING: Setting up {metricbeat} is an admin-level task that requires extra
privileges. As a best practice, grant the setup role to administrators only,
and use a more restrictive role for event publishing.

1. Create the setup role:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_setup** as the role name.

   b. Choose the **monitor** and **manage_ilm** cluster privileges.

   c. On the **metricbeat-\*** indices, choose the **manage** and **write**
   privileges.
+
If the **metricbeat-\*** indices aren't listed, enter that pattern into the
list of indices.

2. Create the setup user:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_setup** as the user name.

   b. Enter the username, password, and other user details.

   c. Assign the following roles to the **metricbeat_setup** user:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Role               | Purpose

| `metricbeat_setup` | Set up {metricbeat}.
| `kibana_admin`     | Load dependencies, such as example dashboards, if available, into {kib}
| `ingest_admin`     | Set up index templates and, if available, ingest pipelines
|===

**Next**: <<beats-monitoring-role,Create a monitoring role>>

[discrete]
[[beats-monitoring-role]]
====== Create a monitoring role and user

To send monitoring data securely, create a monitoring user and grant it the
necessary privileges.

You can use the built-in `beats_system` user, if it’s available in your
environment. Because the built-in users are not available in Elastic Cloud,
these instructions create a user that is explicitly used for monitoring
{metricbeat}.

1. Create the monitoring role:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_monitoring** as the role name.

   b. Choose the **monitor** cluster privilege.

   c. On the **.monitoring-beats-\*** indices, choose the **create_index** and
   **create_doc** privileges.

2. Create the monitoring user:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_monitoring** as the user name.

   b. Enter the username, password, and other user details.

   c. Assign the following roles to the **metricbeat_monitoring** user:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Role                    | Purpose

| `metricbeat_monitoring` | Monitor {metricbeat}.
| `kibana_admin`          | Use {kib}
| `monitoring_user`       | Use Stack Monitoring in {kib} to monitor {metricbeat}
|===

**Next**: <<beats-writer-role,Create a writer role>>

[discrete]
[[beats-writer-role]]
====== Create a writer role and user

Users who publish events to {es} need to create and write to {metricbeat} indices. To minimize the privileges required by the writer role, use the setup role to pre-load dependencies. This section assumes that you’ve
<<beats-setup-role,created the setup role>>.

1. Create the writer role:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_writer** as the role name.

   b. Choose the **monitor** and **read_ilm** cluster privileges.

   c. On the **metricbeat-\*** indices, choose the **create_doc**, **create_index**, and **view_index_metadata** privileges.

2. Create the writer user:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_writer** as the user name.

   b. Enter the username, password, and other user details.

   c. Assign the following roles to the **metricbeat_writer** user:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Role                          | Purpose

| `metricbeat_writer`           | Monitor {metricbeat}
| `remote_monitoring_collector` | Collect monitoring metrics from {metricbeat}
| `remote_monitoring_agent`     | Send monitoring data to the monitoring cluster
|===

**Next**: <<beats-reader-role,Create a reader role>>

[discrete]
[[beats-reader-role]]
====== Create a reader role and user

{kib} users typically need to view dashboards and visualizations that contain
{metricbeat} data. These users might also need to create and edit dashboards
and visualizations. Create the reader role to assign proper privileges to these
users.

1. Create the reader role:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_reader** as the role name.

   b. On the **metricbeat-\*** indices, choose the **read** privilege.

   c. Under **Kibana**, click **Add Kibana privilege**.

   - Under **Spaces**, choose **Default**.

   - Choose **Read** or **All** for Discover, Visualize, Dashboard, and Metrics.

2. Create the reader user:

   a. Enter **metricbeat_reader** as the user name.

   b. Enter the username, password, and other user details.

   c. Assign the following roles to the **metricbeat_reader** user:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Role                          | Purpose

| `metricbeat_reader` | Read {metricbeat} data.
| `monitoring_user`   | Allow users to monitor the health of {metricbeat}
itself. Only assign this role to users who manage {metricbeat}
| `beats_admin`       | Create and manage configurations in {beats} central
management. Only assign this role to users who need to use {beats} central
management.
|===

**Next**: <<configure-metricbeat-tls,Configure {metricbeat} to use TLS>>

[discrete]
[[configure-metricbeat-tls]]
===== Configure {metricbeat} to use TLS

Before starting {metricbeat}, you configure the connections to {es} and
{kib}. You can configure authentication to send data to your secured cluster
using basic authentication, API key authentication, or Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) certificates.

The following instructions use the credentials for the `metricbeat_writer`
and `metricbeat_setup` users that you created. If you need a greater level of
security, we recommend using PKI certificates.

After configuring connections to {es} and {kib}, you'll enable the
`elasticsearch-xpack` module and configure that module to use HTTPS.

WARNING: In production environments, we strongly recommend using a separate
cluster (referred to as the monitoring cluster) to store your data. Using a
separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting
your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring
activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster.

. On the node where you
<<encrypt-http-communication,generated certificates for the HTTP layer>>,
navigate to the `/kibana` directory.

. Copy the `elasticsearch-ca.pem` certificate to the directory where you
installed {metricbeat}.

. Open the `metricbeat.yml` configuration file and configure the connection
to {es}.
+

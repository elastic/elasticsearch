=== Encrypt internode communications  

Now that you've generated a certificate authority and certificates for each node,
you must update your cluster to use these files. 

. Stop each {es} node. For example, if you installed {es} from an archive
distribution, enter `Ctrl-C` on the command line. See 
{ref}/stopping-elasticsearch.html[Stopping {es}].

. On each node, enable Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) for transport
(internode) communications. You must also configure each node to identify itself
using its signed certificate.
+
--
For example, add the following settings in each `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml`
file:

[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true  
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/${node.name}.p12 <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/${node.name}.p12
----
<1> If the file name for your certificate does not match the `node.name` value,
you must put the appropriate file name in each `elasticsearch.yml` file. 

NOTE: The PKCS#12 keystore that is output by the `elasticsearch-certutil` can be
used as both a keystore and a truststore. If you use other tools to manage and 
generate your certificates, you might have different values for these settings,
but that scenario is not covered in this tutorial.

For more information about these settings, see
{ref}/security-settings.html#transport-tls-ssl-settings[Transport TLS settings].
--

. On each node, store the password for PKCS#12 file in the {es} keystore.
+
--
For example, run the following commands on each node: 

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch-keystore create <1>
./bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.secure_password
./bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.secure_password
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<1> If the {es} keystore already exists, this command asks whether you want to
overwrite it. You do not need to overwrite it; you can simply add settings to
your existing {es} keystore.

You are prompted to supply the password value. As you saw in the previous step,
we are using the same file for both the transport TLS keystore and truststore,
therefore you supply the same password for both of these settings.
--

. Start each {es} node. For example, if you installed {es} with a `.tar.gz`
package, run the following command from each {es} directory:
+
--
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See {ref}/starting-elasticsearch.html[Starting {es}].
--

. (Optional) Restart {kib}. For example, if you installed 
{kib} with a `.tar.gz` package, run the following command from the {kib} 
directory:
+
--
["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
./bin/kibana
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See {kibana-ref}/start-stop.html[Starting and stopping {kib}]. 
--

. Verify that your cluster is healthy. For example, use the
{ref}/cluster-health.html[cluster health API]:
+
--
[source,js]
----------------------------------
GET _cluster/health
----------------------------------
// CONSOLE 

Confirm the `status` of your cluster is `green` in the response from this API.

If you encounter errors, you can see some common problems and solutions in
<<trb-security-ssl>>.

=== What's next?

Congratulations! You've encrypted communications between the nodes in your
cluster and can pass the 
{ref}/bootstrap-checks-xpack.html#bootstrap-checks-tls[TLS bootstrap check].

If you want to encrypt communications between other products in the {stack}, see

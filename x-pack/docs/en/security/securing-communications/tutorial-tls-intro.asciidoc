== Tutorial: Encrypting communications

When you enable {es} {security-features}, unless you have a trial license, you
must use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt internode communication. In
this tutorial, you learn how to meet the minimum requirements to pass the 
{ref}/bootstrap-checks-xpack.html#bootstrap-checks-tls[TLS bootstrap check].

NOTE: Single-node clusters that use a loopback interface do not have this
requirement.

=== Before you begin

Ideally, you should do this tutorial only after you complete the 
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}] and
<<security-getting-started,Getting started with security>> tutorials. At a
minimum, you must:

. Install and configure {es} and {kib} in a cluster with a single {es} node, as
described in
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}]. In
particular, this tutorial provides instructions that work with the `zip` and
`tar.gz` packages.

. Verify that you are using a license that includes the encrypted communications
{security-features}. To view your license in {kib}, go to *Management* and click
*License Management*.

By default, when you install {stack} products, they apply basic licenses with no
expiration dates. To complete this tutorial, you must have a basic or trial
license at a minimum. For more information, see {subscriptions} and
<<license-management>>.

. <<get-started-built-in-users,Create passwords for built-in users>>.

. <<get-started-kibana-user,Add the built-in user to {kib}>>.

. Stop {kib}. The method for starting and stopping {kib} varies depending on 
how you installed it. For example, if you installed {kib} from an archive 
distribution (`.tar.gz` or `.zip`), stop it by entering `Ctrl-C` on the command 
line. See {kibana-ref}/start-stop.html[Starting and stopping {kib}]. 

. Stop {es}. For example, if you installed {es} from an archive distribution, 
enter `Ctrl-C` on the command line. See 
{ref}/stopping-elasticsearch.html[Stopping {es}].

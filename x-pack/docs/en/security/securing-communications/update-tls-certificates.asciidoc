[[update-node-certs]]
== Updating node security certificates
You might need to update your TLS certificates if your current node
certificates expire soon, you're adding new nodes to your secured cluster, or
a security breach has broken the trust of your certificate chain. Use the 
<<security-api-ssl,SSL certificate>> API to check when your certificates are
expiring.

In instances where you have access to the original Certificate Authority (CA) key and certificate that you used to sign your existing node certificates (and where you can still trust your CA), you can
<<update-node-certs-same,use that CA to sign the new certificates>>.

If you have to trust a new CA from your organization, or you need to generate
a new CA yourself, you need to use this new CA to sign the new node
certificates and instruct your nodes to trust the new CA. In this case, you'll
<<update-node-certs-different,sign node certificates with your new CA>> and
instruct your nodes to trust this certificate chain.

Depending on which certificates are expiring, you might need to update the
certificates for the transport layer, the HTTP layer, or both. 

Regardless of the scenario, {es} monitors the SSL resources for updates
by default, on a five-second interval. You can just copy the new
certificate and key files (or keystore) into the {es} configuration directory
and your nodes will detect the changes and reload the keys and certificates. 

Because {es} doesn't reload the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration,
you must use *the same file names* if you want to take advantage of automatic certificate and key reloading. 

If you need to update the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration or change
passwords for keys or keystores that are stored in the
<<secure-settings,secure settings>>, then you must complete a
<<use-rolling-restarts,rolling restart>>. {es} will not automatically reload changes for
passwords stored in the secure settings. 

[[use-rolling-restarts]]
.Rolling restarts are preferred
****
While it's possible to do an in-place update for security certificates, using
a <<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>> on your cluster is safer. An in-place update avoids some
complications of a rolling restart, but incurs the following risks:

* If you use PEM files, your certificate and key are in separate files. You
must update both files _simultaneously_ or the node might experience a temporary
period where it cannot establish new connections.
* Updating the certificate and key does not automatically force existing
connections to refresh. This means that even if you make a mistake, a node can
seem like it's functioning but only because it still has existing connections.
It's possible that a node will be unable to connect with other nodes, rendering
it unable to recover from a network outage or node restart.

[[update-node-certs-same]]
=== Update certificates with the same CA
++++
<titleabbrev>With the same CA</titleabbrev>
++++

This procedure assumes that the you have access to the CA certificate and key
that was originally generated (or otherwise held by your organization) and used
to sign the node certificates currently in use. It also assumes that the
clients connecting to {es} on the HTTP layer are configured to trust the CA
certificate.

If you have access to the CA used to sign your existing certificates, you only
need to replace the certificates and keys for each node in your cluster. If you
replace your existing certificates and keys on each node and use the same
filenames, {es} reloads the files starts using the new certificates and keys.

You don't have to restart each node, but doing so forces new TLS connections and is <<use-rolling-restarts,a recommended practice>> when updating certificates.
Therefore, the following steps include a node restart after updating each
certificate.

The following steps provide instructions for generating new node certificates
and keys for both the transport layer and the HTTP layer. You might only need
to replace one of these layer's certificates depending on which of your
certificates are expiring.

[[cert-password-updates]] 
IMPORTANT: If your keystore is password protected, the password
is stored in the {es} secure settings, _and_ the password needs to change, then
you must perform a <<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>> on your cluster.
You must also use a different file name for the keystore so that {es} doesn't
reload the file before the node is restarted.

TIP: If your CA has changed, complete the steps in 
<<update-node-certs-different,update security certificates with a different CA>>.

[[node-certs-same-transport]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the transport layer
The following examples use PKCS#12 files, but the same steps apply to JKS
keystores.

. Open the `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file and check the names and
locations of the keystores that are currently in use. You'll use the same names
for your new certificate.
+
In this example, the keystore and truststore are pointing to different files.
Your configuration might use the same file that contains the certificate and CA.
In this case, include the path to that file for both the keystore and truststore.
+
[NOTE]
====
These instructions assume that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
CA and the verification mode is set to `certificate`. This setting ensures that
nodes to not attempt to perform hostname verification.

[[transport-layer-sameca-whatsnext]]
==== What's next?
Well done! You've updated the keystore for the transport layer. You can also
<<node-certs-same-http,update the keystore for the HTTP layer>> if
necessary. If you're not updating the keystore for the HTTP layer, then you're
all set. 

[[node-certs-same-http]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the HTTP layer
Other components such as {kib} or any of the Elastic language clients verify
this certificate when they connect to {es}.

NOTE: If your organization has its own CA, you'll need to 
<<certutil-csr,generate Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)>>. CSRs contain
information that your CA uses to generate and sign a certificate.

. On any node in your cluster where {es} is installed, run the {es} HTTP
certificate tool.
+
[source,shell]
----
./bin/elasticsearch-certutil http
----
+
This command generates a `.zip` file that contains certificates and keys
to use with {es} and {kib}. Each folder contains a `README.txt`
explaining how to use these files.

   a. When asked if you want to generate a CSR, enter `n`.

   b. When asked if you want to use an existing CA, enter `y`.

   c. Enter the absolute path to your CA, such as the path to the
    `elastic-stack-ca.p12` file.

   d. Enter the password for your CA.

   e. Enter an expiration value for your certificate. You can enter the
   validity period in years, months, or days. For example, enter `1y` for one
   year.

   f. When asked if you want to generate one certificate per node, enter `y`.
+
Each certificate will have its own private key, and will be issued for a
specific hostname or IP address.

   g. When prompted, enter the name of the first node in your cluster. It's
   helpful to use the same node name as the value for the `node.name`
   parameter in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

   h. Enter all hostnames used to connect to your first node. These hostnames
   will be added as DNS names in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field in your certificate.
+
List every hostname and variant used to connect to your cluster over HTTPS.

   i. Enter the IP addresses that clients can use to connect to your node.

   j. Repeat these steps for each additional node in your cluster.

. After generating a certificate for each of your nodes, enter a password for
   your private key when prompted.

. Unzip the generated `elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip` file. This compressed file
   contains two directories; one each for {es} and {kib}. Within the `/elasticsearch`
   directory is a directory for each node that you specified with its own
   `http.p12` file. For example:
+
--

. If necessary, rename the `http.p12` file to match the name of your existing
certificate for HTTP client communications. For example, `node1-http.p12`.

. [[start-rolling-restart-http,step 5]]On the current node in your cluster where you're updating the keystore,
start a <<restart-cluster-rolling,rolling restart>>.

Stop at the step indicating *Perform any needed changes*, and then proceed to
the next step in this procedure.

. Replace your existing keystore with the new keystore, ensuring that the
file names match. For example, `node1-http.p12`.
+
IMPORTANT: If your 
<<cert-password-updates,keystore password is changing>>, then save the
keystore with a new filename so that {es} doesn't attempt to reload the file
before you update the password.

. If you needed to save the new keystore with a new filename, update the
`ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file to use the filename of the new keystore.
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true

If you have to trust a new CA from your organization, or you need to generate a new CA yourself, use this new CA to sign the new node certificates and instruct your nodes to trust the new CA. 

[[node-certs-different-transport]]
==== Generate a new certificate for the transport layer
Create a new CA certificate, or get the CA certificate of your organization,
and add it to your existing CA truststore. After you finish updating your certificates for all nodes, you can remove the old CA
certificate from your truststore (but not before!).

NOTE: The following examples use PKCS#12 files, but the same steps apply to JKS
keystores.

. Open the `ES_PATH_CONF/elasticsearch.yml` file and check the names and
locations of the keystores that are currently in use. You'll use the same names
for your new keystores.
+
In this example, the keystore and truststore are using different files.
Your configuration might use the same file for both the keystore and the 
truststore.

[%collapsible%open]
.Command parameters
====
   `--pem`:: Generates a directory containing a CA certificate and key in PEM
   format instead of PKCS#12. 
====

    a. Enter a name for the compressed output file that will contain your
    certificate and key, or accept the default name of `elastic-stack-ca.zip`.

    b. Unzip the output file. The resulting directory contains a CA certificate
    (`ca.crt`) and a private key (`ca.key`).
+
--
IMPORTANT: Keep these file in a secure location as they contain the private key
for your CA. 
--

. On *every* node in your cluster, import the new `ca.crt` certificate into your
existing CA truststore. This step ensures that your cluster trusts the new CA
certificate. This example uses the Java `keytool` utility to import the
certificate into the `elastic-stack-ca.p12` CA truststore.

Security needs vary depending on whether you're developing locally on your
laptop or securing all communications in a production environment. Because
security needs vary, the following scenarios provide options for configuring
the Elastic Stack.

Each subsequent scenario builds on the previous one so that you can add
additional security by building on the existing layer.

These scenarios don't cover every situation, but provide a framework for
securing {es} and the Elastic Stack based on typical use cases.

NOTE: If you want to enable security by default when you start {es} for the
first time without manually configuring security, refer to
<<configuring-stack-security,Starting the Elastic Stack with security enabled>>.

=== Minimal security ({es} Development)

If you want to set up {es} on your laptop and start developing, this scenario
is for you. This configuration prevents unauthorized access to your local
cluster by setting up passwords for the built-in users. You also configure
password authentication for {kib}.

// tag::minimal-security-note[]
IMPORTANT: The minimal security scenario is not sufficient for
<<dev-vs-prod-mode,production mode>> clusters. If your cluster has multiple
nodes, you must enable minimal security and then
<<security-basic-setup,configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)>> between
nodes.

// end::minimal-security-note[]

<<security-minimal-setup,Set up minimal security>>

[[security-basic-overview]]
=== Basic security ({es} Production)

This scenario builds on the minimal security requirements by adding transport
Layer Security (TLS) for communication between nodes. This additional layer
requires that nodes verify security certificates, which prevents unauthorized
nodes from joining your {es} cluster.

Your external HTTP traffic between {es} and {kib} won't be encrypted, but
internode communication will be secured.

[[security-basic-https-overview]]
=== Basic security plus secured HTTPS traffic (Elastic Stack)

This scenario builds on the one for basic security and secures all HTTP
traffic with TLS. In addition to configuring TLS on the transport interface of
your {es} cluster, you configure TLS on the HTTP interface for both
{es} and {kib}.

NOTE: If you need mutual (bidirectional) TLS on the HTTP layer, then you'll
need to configure mutual authenticated encryption.

You then configure {kib} and Beats to communicate with
{es} using TLS so that all communications are encrypted. This level
of security is strong, and ensures that any communications in and out of your
cluster are secure.

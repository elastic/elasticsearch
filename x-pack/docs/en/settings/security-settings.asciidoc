[[security-settings]]
=== Security settings in {es}
++++
<titleabbrev>Security settings</titleabbrev>
++++

By default, {security} is disabled when you have a basic or trial license. To
enable {security}, use the `xpack.security.enabled` setting.

You configure `xpack.security` settings  to
<<anonymous-access-settings, enable anonymous access>>
and perform message authentication,
<<field-document-security-settings, set up document and field level security>>,
<<realm-settings, configure realms>>,
<<ssl-tls-settings, encrypt communications with SSL>>, and
<<auditing-settings, audit security events>>.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file,
with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the {es} keystore.
For more information about creating and updating the {es} keystore, see
<<secure-settings>>.

[float]
[[general-security-settings]]
==== General security settings
`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` to enable {security} on the node. +
+
If set to `false`, which is the default value for basic and trial licenses,
{security} is disabled. It also affects all {kib} instances that connect to this
{es} instance; you do not need to disable {security} in those `kibana.yml` files.
For more information about disabling {security} in specific {kib} instances, see  {kibana-ref}/security-settings-kb.html[{kib} security settings].

`xpack.security.hide_settings`::
A comma-separated list of settings that are omitted from the results of the
<<cluster-nodes-info,cluster nodes info API>>. You can use wildcards to include
multiple settings in the list.  For example, the following value hides all the
settings for the ad1 realm: `xpack.security.authc.realms.ad1.*`. The API already
omits all `ssl` settings, `bind_dn`, and `bind_password` due to the
sensitive nature of the information.

[float]
[[password-security-settings]]
==== Default password security settings
`xpack.security.authc.accept_default_password`::
In `elasticsearch.yml`, set this to `false` to disable support for the default "changeme" password.

[float]
[[anonymous-access-settings]]
==== Anonymous access settings
You can configure the following anonymous access settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.  For more information, see {xpack-ref}/anonymous-access.html[
Enabling anonymous access].

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.username`::
The username (principal) of the anonymous user. Defaults to `_es_anonymous_user`.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.roles`::
The roles to associate with the anonymous user. Required.

`xpack.security.authc.anonymous.authz_exception`::
When `true`, an HTTP 403 response is returned if the anonymous user
does not have the appropriate permissions for the requested action. The
user is not prompted to provide credentials to access the requested
resource. When set to `false`, a HTTP 401 is returned and the user
can provide credentials with the appropriate permissions to gain
access. Defaults to `true`.

[float]
[[field-document-security-settings]]
==== Document and field level security settings

You can set the following document and field level security
settings in `elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/field-and-document-access-control.html[Setting up document and field
level security].

`xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled`::
Set to `false` to prevent document and field level security
from being configured. Defaults to `true`.

[float]
[[token-service-settings]]
==== Token service settings

You can set the following token service settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`.

`xpack.security.authc.token.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable the built-in token service. Defaults to `true` unless
 `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` is `false`. This prevents sniffing the token
  from a connection over plain http.

`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout`::
The length of time that a token is valid for. By default this value is `20m` or
20 minutes. The maximum value is 1 hour.

[float]
[[realm-settings]]
==== Realm settings
You configure realm settings in the `xpack.security.authc.realms`
namespace in `elasticsearch.yml`. For example:

[source,yaml]
----------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms:

    realm1:
        type: native
        order: 0
        ...

<<ref-realm-settings,settings that are valid for all realms>>, you can specify  
the following settings: 

`idp.entity_id`::
The Entity ID of the SAML Identity Provider. An Entity ID is a URI with a 
maximum length of 1024 characters. It can be a URL (https://idp.example.com/) or 
a URN (`urn:example.com:idp`) and can be found in the configuration or the SAML 
metadata of the Identity Provider.

`idp.metadata.path`::
The path _(recommended)_ or URL to a SAML 2.0 metadata file describing the
capabilities and configuration of the Identity Provider.
If a path is provided, then it is resolved relative to the {es} config
directory.
If a URL is provided, then it must be either a `file` URL or a `https` URL.
{security} automatically polls this metadata resource and reloads 
the IdP configuration when changes are detected.
File based resources are polled at a frequency determined by the global {es}

user's X.500 _Distinguished Name_. 

`attribute_patterns.principal`::
A Java regular expression that is matched against the SAML attribute specified
by `attributes.pattern` before it is applied to the user's _principal_ property.
The attribute value must match the pattern and the value of the first
_capturing group_ is used as the principal. For example, `^([^@]+)@example\\.com$` 
matches email addresses from the "example.com" domain and uses the local-part as 
the principal.

[[load-balancing]]
===== Load balancing and failover

The `load_balance.type` setting can have the following values: 

* `failover`: The URLs specified are used in the order that they are specified. 
The first server that can be connected to will be used for all subsequent 
connections. If a connection to that server fails then the next server that a 
connection can be established to will be used for subsequent connections.
* `dns_failover`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be specified.
This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all IP 
addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections to the Active Directory 
or LDAP server will always be tried in the order in which they were retrieved. 
This differs from `failover` in that there is no reordering of the list and if a 
server has failed at the beginning of the list, it will still be tried for each 
subsequent connection.
* `round_robin`: Connections will continuously iterate through the list of 
provided URLs. If a server is unavailable, iterating through the list of URLs 
will continue until a successful connection is made.
* `dns_round_robin`: In this mode of operation, only a single URL may be 
specified. This URL must contain a DNS name. The system will be queried for all 
IP addresses that correspond to this DNS name. Connections will continuously 
iterate through the list of addresses. If a server is unavailable, iterating 
through the list of URLs will continue until a successful connection is made.

[float]
[[ssl-tls-settings]]
==== Default TLS/SSL settings
You can configure the following TLS/SSL settings in
`elasticsearch.yml`. For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting communications]. These settings will be used
for all of {xpack} unless they have been overridden by more specific
settings such as those for HTTP or Transport.

`xpack.ssl.supported_protocols`::
Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols: `SSLv2Hello`,
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`. Defaults to `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.1`,
`TLSv1`.

`xpack.ssl.client_authentication`::
Controls the server's behavior in regard to requesting a certificate
from client connections. Valid values are `required`, `optional`, and `none`.
`required` forces a client to present a certificate, while `optional`
requests a client certificate but the client is not required to present one.
Defaults to `required`. This global setting is not applicable for HTTP, see
 <<http-tls-ssl-settings>>.

`xpack.ssl.verification_mode`::
Controls the verification of certificates. Valid values are:
- `full`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a trusted
       authority (CA) and also verifies that the server's hostname (or IP
       address) matches the names identified within the certificate.
- `certificate`, which verifies that the provided certificate is signed by a
       trusted authority (CA), but does not perform any hostname verification.
- `none`, which performs _no verification_ of the server's certificate. This mode
       disables many of the security benefits of SSL/TLS and should only be
       used after very careful consideration. It is primarily intended as a
       temporary diagnostic mechanism when attempting to resolve TLS errors,
       and its use on production clusters is strongly discouraged.
+
The default value is `full`.

`xpack.ssl.cipher_suites`::
Supported cipher suites can be found in Oracle's http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html[
Java Cryptography Architecture documentation]. Defaults to `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`,
`TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`. If the _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
Jurisdiction Policy Files_ has been installed, the default value also includes `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`,
`TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`,

===== Default TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the
trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS connection.
If none of the settings below are specified, this will default to the <<ssl-tls-settings, {xpack}
defaults>>. If no trusted certificates are configured, the default certificates that are trusted by the JVM will be
trusted along with the certificate(s) from the <<tls-ssl-key-settings, key settings>>. The key and certificate must be in place
for connections that require client authentication or when acting as a SSL enabled server.

[float]
===== PEM encoded files

When using PEM encoded files, use the following settings:

`xpack.ssl.key`::
Path to the PEM encoded file containing the private key.

`xpack.ssl.key_passphrase`::
The passphrase that is used to decrypt the private key. This value is
optional as the key might not be encrypted.

`xpack.ssl.secure_key_passphrase` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::

Password to the truststore.

[float]
===== PKCS#12 files

When using PKCS#12 container files (`.p12` or `.pfx`), which contain the
private key, certificate, and certificates that should be trusted, use
the following settings:

`xpack.ssl.keystore.path`::

`xpack.ssl.truststore.password`::
Password to the truststore.

`xpack.ssl.truststore.secure_password` (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password to the truststore.

[[pkcs12-truststore-note]]
[NOTE]
Storing trusted certificates in a PKCS#12 file, although supported, is
uncommon in practice. The {ref}/certutil.html[`elasticsearch-certutil`] tool,
as well as Java's `keytool`, are designed to generate PKCS#12 files that
can be used both as a keystore and as a truststore, but this may not be the
case for container files that are created using other tools. Usually,
PKCS#12 files only contain secret and private entries. To confirm that
a PKCS#12 container includes trusted certificate ("anchor") entries look for
`2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1: <Unsupported tag 6>` in the
`openssl pkcs12 -info` output, or `trustedCertEntry` in the
`keytool -list` output.

As an example, lets look at the key setting. For the default transport
this is `xpack.security.transport.ssl.key`. In order to use this setting in a
transport profile, use the prefix `transport.profiles.$PROFILE.xpack.security.` and
append the portion of the setting after `xpack.security.transport.`. For the key

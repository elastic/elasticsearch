=== Listing Watches

Currently there is not dedicated API for listing the stored watches. However,
since {watcher} stores its watches in the `.watches` index, you can list them
by executing a search on this index.

IMPORTANT:	You can only perform read actions on the `.watches` index. You must
            use the {watcher} APIs to create, update, and delete watches. If {es}
            {security-features} are enabled, we recommend you only grant users
            `read` privileges on the `.watches` index.

For example, the following returns the first 100 watches:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET .watches/_search
{
  "size" : 100
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:my_active_watch]

=== Change List

[float]
==== 2.4.2
November 22, 2016

.Bug Fixes
* Deleting a watch now is independent from its current execution state in
order to prevent failed deletions with watches having small intervals
* Chain input: Parsing now throws an exception if a data structure is added, that cannot keep its order

[float]
==== 2.4.1
September 28, 2016

.Bug Fixes
* Fixed a serialization error that resulted in the watch history not being
written when a proxy is specified in a watch.
* Triggered watches are now correctly deleted from the `.triggered-watches`
index if they are rejected due to a full thread pool.
* Deleting or closing the `.watches` index now correctly cleans up the
in-memory watch store so the watches are no longer executed.
* If the HTTP request for an attachment fails, the error message is included
in the watch history.
* Fixed a possible exception when chained inputs don't execute successfully.

.Enhancements
*  Hostname verification can be disabled for Watcher
HTTP actions.
* Running watches can be updated and deleted.

[float]
==== 2.4.0
August 31, 2016

.Enhancements
* The HTTP headers of a response are now part of the payload and can be accessed via `ctx.payload._headers`


[float]
==== 2.3.5
August 3, 2016

.Bug Fixes
* The watch history was not written, if one of the chained inputs resulted in a failure as well as an input containing a field name with dots
* Status of an acked watch, whose condition evaluates to false again is now properly persisted and not lost in case of a master node switch
* Fixed the watch history template so payloads and request bodies are handled
correctly. To update an existing installation, delete the existing watch history
template by running `DELETE /_template/watch_history` and the correct template
will be autocreated. To verify the template is recreated, call `GET
/_template/watch_history`. Note that this just updates the template, so you
need to wait one day for this update to take effect when a new history index is
created.
* The `watcher.http.proxy.port` setting for global proxy configuration was not applied correctly.

[float]
==== 2.3.4
July 7, 2016

.Bug Fixes
* Putting a new watch with state `active=false` now stores that state correctly
on a multi node cluster.
* Fixed the watch history template so nested request bodies are handled
correctly. To update an existing installation, delete the existing watch history
template by running `DELETE /_template/watch_history` and the correct template
will be autocreated. To verify the template is recreated, call `GET
/_template/watch_history`. Note that this just updates the template, so you
need to wait one day for this update to take effect when a new history index is
created.
* The HTML sanitizer now supports border and cellpadding attributes on table
elements and the colspan and rowspan attributes on <td> and <tr> elements.
* Fixed the Watcher/Marvel examples in the documentation.

[float]
==== 2.3.3
May 18, 2016

.Enhancements
* Adds support for Elasticsearch 2.3.3

[float]
==== 2.3.2
April 26, 2016

.Bug Fixes
* All SMTP connection timeouts are now set to two minutes by default to prevent
a watch from getting stuck.
* HTTP headers from responses that contained dots led to exceptions when the
HTTP response was stored in the watch history. All dots in any header names
are now replaced with underscores. For example, a header called `foo.bar`
becomes `foo_bar`
* Hipchat action: Fall back to the default Hipchat color and format if they
are not specified at the account level or within the action itself, instead
of failing.

[float]

* Support `ignore_condition` and `record_execution` as parameters in the
  {ref}/watcher-api-execute-watch.html[Execute Watch API]

.New Features
* Added <<actions-pagerduty, PagerDuty action>>
* Added support for adding <<configuring-email-attachments, attachments to emails>>
  via HTTP requests and superseding and deprecating the usage of `attach_data`
  in order to use this feature

* Adds support for configuring a proxy in the webhook action, http input and
  configuring a default proxy (which is also used by the slack action), using the
  `watcher.http.proxy.host` and `watcher.http.proxy.port` settings.

.Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where the scheduler may get stuck during Watcher startup. This
  caused no watches to ever fire.
* Fixed an issue where under specific conditions Watcher would not start if there
  are not finished watch executions from the previous time that watcher was
  running and those watch execution are unable the execute during the current
  start process.

[float]
==== 2.0.1
November 24, 2015

.Enhancement
* Adds support for Elasticsearch 2.0.1.

.Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue where under specific conditions Watcher would not start if
  there are not finished watch executions from the previous time that watcher
  was running and those watch execution are unable the execute during the current
  start process.

[float]
==== 2.0.0
October 28, 2015

.Breaking Changes
* The dynamic index names support has been removed and Elasticsearch's date math
  index names support should be used instead. The only difference between Watcher's
  dynamic index names support and Elasticsearch's date math index names support is
  how timezones are expressed. In Watcher this is done via node settings, in
  Elasticsearch the timezone is part of the date math index names support. Only
  if you're using dynamic index names with timezones in Watcher then you need to
  upgrade your watches after the upgrade, otherwise your watches will work as
  they did before the upgrade. For example if `watcher.dynamic_indices.time_zone`
  setting was set to `+01:00` and a watch has the following index name
  `<logstash-{now/d}>` then after the upgrade you need to update this watch to
  use the following index name `<logstash-{now/d{YYYY.MM.dd|+01:00}}>`.

.New Features
* Added new <<actions-hipchat, HipChat Action>>
* Added new <<actions-slack, Slack Action>>
* Watches now have an <<watch-active-state, active state>>. In addition, a new
  API was added to {ref}/watcher-api-activate-watch.html[activate]
  /{ref}watcher-api-deactivate-watch.html[deactivate] registered watches.
* Added new <<condition-array-compare, array_compare>>, that can compare an array
  of values in the <<watch-execution-context, Watch Execution Context Model>>
  to a given value.

.Enhancements
* Watcher continuously checks if the index templates for `.watches`,
  `.triggered_watches` and `.watch_history-*` exist. Whereas before the existence
  of these index templates was only checked at Watcher startup time. The absence
  of these index templates leads to watcher data being indexed incorrectly, which
  then can cause Watcher to behave incorrectly.
* If Watcher was stopped via the stop Watcher api and after that a master
  election took place then Watcher would then unexpectedly start.
* During Watcher start up only wait for the shards of the `.watches` and
  `.triggered_watches` indices to be available. Before Watcher also waited for
  the shards of the `.watch_history-*` indices, which wasn't needed. This
  improved time it takes for Watcher to startup.
* If `action.auto_create_index` setting has been configured then Watcher will
  check if the setting is too restrictive. If the `action.auto_create_index` is
  too restrictive then Watcher will fail during startup with a descriptive error
  message.

.Bug Fixes
* If Watcher was installed with Security then the Watcher index templates couldn't
  be stored and could lead to Watcher behaving incorrectly. This was caused by
  Watcher not detecting correctly if Security was installed.
* Update `croneval` command line utility to properly handle whitespaces in the
  elasticsearch home path.
* Fixed an issue where the scheduler may get stuck during Watcher startup. This
  caused no watches to ever fire.
* Fixed url encoding issue in http input and webhook output. The url params were
  url encoded twice.

[float]
==== 1.0.1
July 29, 2015

.Enhancements
* Dynamic index names now support specifying a time zone to be used when
  computing the names of the indices. The default is UTC. Previously, the
  computation was fixed to always use UTC when computing the names of the
  indices.

.Bug Fixes
* Fixed a compatibility issue with Elasticsearch 1.6.1 and 1.7.2, which were
  released earlier today.

[float]
==== 1.0.0
June 25, 2015

.Enhancements
* Added execution time aware dynamic index names support to `index`
  action, `search` input, and `search` transform.
* You must now explicitly specify the unit when configuring any time value.
  (Numeric-only values are no longer supported.)
* Cleaned up the {ref}/watcher-api-get-watch.html[Get Watch API] response.
* Cleaned up the <<watcher-api-stats, Stats API>> response.

* Email html body sanitization is now <<email-html-sanitization, configurable>>.
* It is now possible to configure timeouts for http requests in
  <<http-input-attributes, HTTP input>> and <<webhook-action-attributes, webhook actions>>.

[float]
==== 1.0.0-Beta2
June 10, 2015

.New Features
* <<actions-ack-throttle, Acking and Throttling>> are now applied at the action
  level rather than the watch level.
* Added support for <<anatomy-actions-index-multi-doc-support, multi-doc>>
  indexing to the index action.
* Added a queued watches metric that's accessible via the <<watcher-api-stats, Stats API>>.
* Added a currently-executing watches metric that's accessible via the
  <<watcher-api-stats, Stats API>>.

.Enhancements
* The <<condition-compare, compare condition>> result now includes the value of
  each field that was referenced in the comparison.
* The <<watcher-api-execute-watch, Execute API>> now supports a default trigger
  event (**breaking change**).
* The `watch_record` document structure in the `.watch_history-*` indices has
  changed significantly (**breaking change**).
* A new internal index was introduced - `.triggered_watches`
* Added support for headers in the <<actions-webhook, Webhook Action>> result
  and the <<input-http, HTTP Input>> result.
* Add plain text response body support for the <<input-http, HTTP Input>>.

.Bug Fixes
* Disallow negative time value settings for <<actions-ack-throttle, `throttle_period`>>
* Added support for separate keystore and truststore in <<actions-webhook, Webhook Action>>
  and <<input-http, HTTP Input>>.

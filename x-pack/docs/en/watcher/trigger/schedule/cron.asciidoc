[[schedule-cron]]
==== `cron` schedule

A <<trigger-schedule, `schedule`>> trigger that enables you to use a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[cron] style expression to specify when you
want the scheduler to start the watch execution. {watcher} uses the cron parser
from the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz Job Scheduler]. For more
information about writing Quartz cron expressions, see the
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.2.x/tutorials/tutorial-lesson-06.html[Quartz CronTrigger Tutorial].

WARNING:  While `cron` triggers are super powerful, we recommend using one of
          the other schedule types if you can, as they are much more
          straightforward to configure. If you use `cron`, construct your `cron`
          expressions with care to be sure you are actually setting the schedule
          you want. You can use the <<croneval, `elasticsearch-croneval`>> tool to validate
          your cron expressions and see what the resulting trigger times will be.

===== Cron Expressions

A cron expression is a string of the following form:

[source,txt]
------------------------------
    <seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day_of_month> <month> <day_of_week> [year]
------------------------------

All elements are required except for `year`. <<schedule-cron-elements>> shows
the valid values for each element in a cron expression.

The special characters you can use in a cron expression are described in
<<schedule-cron-special-characters>>. The names of months and days of the week
are not case sensitive. For example, `MON` and `mon` are equivalent.

NOTE: Currently, you must specify `?` for either the `day_of_week` or
      `day_of_month`. Explicitly specifying both values is not supported.

[[schedule-cron-special-characters]]
.Cron Special Characters
[options="header"]
|======
| Special Character | Description

| *                 | All values. Selects every possible value for a field. For
                      example, `*` in the `hours` field means "every hour".

| ?                 | No specific value. Use when you don't care what the value
                      is. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger on a
                      particular day of the month, but don't care what day of
                      the week that happens to be, you can specify `?` in the
                      `day_of_week` field.

| -                 | A range of values (inclusive). Use to separate a minimum
                      and maximum value. For example, if you want the schedule
                      to trigger every hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, you
                      could specify  `9-17` in the `hours` field.

| ,                 | Multiple values. Use to separate multiple values for a
                      field. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger
                      every Tuesday and Thursday, you could specify `TUE,THU`
                      in the `day_of_week` field.

| /                 | Increment. Use to separate values when specifying a time
                      increment. The first value represents the starting point,
                      and the second value represents the interval. For example,
                      if you want the schedule to trigger every 20 minutes
                      starting at the top of the hour, you could specify `0/20`
                      in the `minutes` field. Similarly, specifying `1/5` in
                      `day_of_month` field will trigger every 5 days starting on
                      the first day of the month.

| L                 | Last. Use in the `day_of_month` field to mean the last day
                      of the month--day 31 for January, day 28 for February in
                      non-leap years, day 30 for April, and so on. Use alone in
                      the `day_of_week` field in place of `7` or `SAT`, or after
                      a particular day of the week to select the last day of that
                      type in the month. For example `6L` means the last Friday
                      of the month. You can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month`
                      field to specify the last weekday of the month. Avoid using
                      the `L` option when specifying lists or ranges of values,
                      as the results likely won't be what you expect.

| W                 | Weekday. Use to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest
                      the given day. As an example, if you specify `15W` in the
                      `day_of_month` field and the 15th is a Saturday, the
                      schedule will trigger on the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday,
                      the schedule will trigger on Monday the 16th. If the 15th
                      is a Tuesday, the schedule will trigger on Tuesday the 15th.
                      However if you specify `1W` as the value for `day_of_month`,
                      and the 1st is a Saturday, the schedule will trigger on
                      Monday the 3rd--it won't jump over the month boundary. You
                      can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month` field to specify the
                      last weekday of the month. You can only use the `W` option
                      when the `day_of_month` is a single day--it is not valid
                      when specifying a range or list of days.

| #                 | Nth XXX day in a month. Use in the `day_of_week` field to
                      specify the nth XXX day of the month. For example, if you
                      specify `6#1`, the schedule will trigger on the first
                      Friday of the month. Note that if you specify `3#5` and
                      there are not 5 Tuesdays in a particular month, the
                      schedule won't trigger that month.

===== Configuring a Cron Schedule

To configure a `cron` schedule, you simply specify the cron expression as a
string value. For example, the following snippet configures a `cron` schedule
that triggers every day at noon:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "trigger" : {
    "schedule" : {
      "cron" : "0 0 12 * * ?"
    }
  }
  ...
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

===== Configuring a Multiple Times Cron Schedule

To configure a `cron` schedule that triggers multiple times, you can
specify an array of cron expressions. For example, the following `cron`
schedule triggers every even minute during weekdays and every uneven
minute during the weekend:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "trigger" : {
    "schedule" : {
      "cron" : [
        "0 0/2 * ? * MON-FRI"",
        "0 1-59/2 * ? * SAT-SUN"
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

[[croneval]]
===== Verifying cron expressions

The {es} {alert-features} provide a
{ref}/elasticsearch-croneval.html[`elasticsearch-croneval`] command line tool
that you can use to verify that your cron expressions are valid and produce the
expected results. This tool is provided in the `$ES_HOME/bin` directory.

To verify a cron expression, simply pass it in as a parameter to
`elasticsearch-croneval`:

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-croneval "0 0/1 * * * ?"
--------------------------------------------------

If the cron expression is valid, `elasticsearch-croneval` displays the next 10
times that the schedule will be triggered. You can specify the `-c` option to
control how many future trigger times are displayed.

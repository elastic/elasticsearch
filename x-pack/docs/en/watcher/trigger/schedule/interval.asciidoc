==== Interval schedule

A <<trigger-schedule,`schedule`>> that triggers at a fixed time interval. The
interval can be set in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks:

* `"Xs"` - trigger every `X` seconds. For example, `"30s"` means every 30 seconds.
* `"Xm"` - trigger every `X` minutes. For example, `"5m"` means every 5 minutes.
* `"Xh"` - trigger every `X` hours. For example, `"12h"` means every 12 hours.
* `"Xd"` - trigger every `X` days. For example, `"3d"` means every 3 days.
* `"Xw"` - trigger every `X` weeks. For example, `"2w"` means every 2 weeks.

If you don't specify a time unit, it defaults to seconds.

NOTE: The interval value differs from the standard _time value_ used in
      Elasticsearch. You cannot configure intervals in milliseconds or
      nanoseconds.

===== Configuring an interval schedule

To configure an `interval` schedule, you specify a string value that represents
the interval. If you omit the unit of time (`s`,`m`, `h`, `d`, or `w`), it
defaults to seconds.

For example, the following `interval` schedule triggers every five minutes:

{
  "trigger" : {
    "schedule" : {
      "interval" : "5m"
    }
  }

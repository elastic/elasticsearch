  Built-in default ingest pipeline for logs-apm.app.*-* data streams.

  This pipeline exists purely for routing, which cannot be
  performed in a final pipeline, and for invoking user-defined
  custom pipelines. All built-in processing occurs in the final
  pipelines.
processors:
# Invoke user-defined custom pipelines, in ascending order of specificity:
- pipeline:
    name: global@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true
- pipeline:
    name: logs@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true
- pipeline:
    name: logs-apm.app@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true

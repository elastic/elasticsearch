  Built-in default ingest pipeline for traces-apm-* data streams.

  This pipeline exists purely for routing, which cannot be
  performed in a final pipeline, and for invoking user-defined
  custom pipelines. All built-in processing occurs in the final
  pipeline.
processors:
# Invoke user-defined custom pipelines, in ascending order of specificity:
- pipeline:
    name: global@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true
- pipeline:
    name: traces@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true
- pipeline:
    name: traces-apm@custom
    ignore_missing_pipeline: true

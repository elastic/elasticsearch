/**
 * A AuthenticationFailureHandler is responsible for the handling of a request that has failed authentication. This must
 * consist of returning an exception and this exception can have headers to indicate authentication is required or another
 * HTTP operation such as a redirect.
 * <p>
 * For example, when using Basic authentication, most clients wait to send credentials until they have been challenged
 * for them. In this workflow a client makes a request, the server responds with a 401 status with the header
 * <code>WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=auth-realm</code>, and then the client will send credentials. The same scheme also
 * applies for other methods of authentication, with changes to the value provided in the WWW-Authenticate header.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, some methods of authentication may require a different status code. When using an single sign on system,
 * clients will often retrieve a token from a single sign on system that is presented to the server and verified. When a
 * client does not provide such a token, then the server can choose to redirect the client to the single sign on system to
 * retrieve a token. This can be accomplished in the AuthenticationFailureHandler by setting the
 * {@link org.elasticsearch.rest.RestStatus#FOUND}
 * with a <code>Location</code> header that contains the location to redirect the user to.

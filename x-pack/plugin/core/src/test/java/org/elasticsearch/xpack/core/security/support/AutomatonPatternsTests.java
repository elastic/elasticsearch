    /**
     * RCS 2.0 allows a single API key to define "replication" and "search" blocks. If both are defined, this results in an API key with 2
     * sets of indices permissions. Due to the way API keys (and roles) work across the multiple index permission, the set of index
     * patterns allowed are effectively the most generous of the sets of index patterns since the index patterns are OR'ed together. For
     * example, `foo` OR `*` results in access to `*`. So, if you have "search" access defined as `foo`, but replication access defined
     * as `*`, the API key effectively allows access to index pattern `*`. This means that the access for API keys that define both
     * "search" and "replication", the action names used are the primary means by which we can constrain CCS to the set of "search" indices
     * as well as how we constrain CCR to the set "replication" indices. For example, if "replication" ever allowed access to
     * `indices:data/read/get` for `*` , then the "replication" permissions would effectively enable users of CCS to get documents,
     * even if "search" is never defined in the RCS 2.0 API key. This obviously is not desirable and in practice when both "search" and
     * "replication" are defined the isolation between CCS and CCR is only achieved because the action names for the workflows do not
     * overlap. This test helps to ensure that the actions names used for RCS 2.0 do not bleed over between search and replication.

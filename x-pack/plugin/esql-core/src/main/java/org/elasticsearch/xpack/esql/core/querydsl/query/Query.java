/**
 * Intermediate representation of queries that is rewritten to fetch

 * Elasticsearch {@link QueryBuilder}s.
 * <p>
 *     Our expression language spits out one of three values for any
 *     comparison, {@code true}, {@code false}, and {@code null}.
 *     Lucene's queries either match or don't match. They don't have
 *     a concept of {@code null}, at least not in the sense we need.
 *     The Lucene queries produced by {@link #asBuilder()} produce
 *     queries that do not match documents who's comparison would
 *     return {@code null}. This is what we want in {@code WHERE}
 *     style operations. But when you need to negate the matches you
 *     need to make only {@code false} return values into matches -
 *     {@code null} returns should continue to not match. You can
 *     do that with the {@link #negate} method.

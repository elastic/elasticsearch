/**
 * Implement an evaluator for a function reducing multivalued fields into a
 * single valued field from a static {@code process} method.
 * <p>
 *     Annotated methods can have three "shapes":
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>pairwise processing</li>
 *     <li>accumulator processing</li>
 *     <li>position at a time processing</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *     Pairwise processing is <strong>generally</strong> simpler and looks
 *     like {@code int process(int current, int next)}. Use it when the result
 *     is a primitive.</p>
 * <p>
 *     Accumulator processing is a bit more complex and looks like
 *     {@code void process(State state, int v)} and it useful when you need to
 *     accumulate more data than fits in a primitive result. Think Kahan summation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Position at a time processing just hands the block, start index, and end index
 *     to the processor and is useful when none of the others fit. It looks like
 *     {@code long process(LongBlock block, int start, int end)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Pairwise and accumulator processing support a {@code finish = "finish_method"}
 *     parameter on the annotation which is used to, well, "finish" processing after
 *     all values have been received. Again, think reading the sum from the
 *     Kahan summation. Or doing the division for an "average" operation.
 *     This method is required for accumulator processing.
 * </p>

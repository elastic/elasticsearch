/**
 * This aggregator calculates the centroid of a set of geo shapes.
 * It is assumed that the geo shapes are encoded as WKB BytesRef.
 * This requires that the planner has NOT planned that shapes are loaded from the index as doc-values, but from source instead.
 * This is also used for final aggregations and aggregations in the coordinator node.

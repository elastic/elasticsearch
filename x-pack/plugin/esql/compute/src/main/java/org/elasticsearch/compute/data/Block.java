/**
 * A Block is a columnar representation of homogenous data. It has a position (row) count, and
 * various data retrieval methods for accessing the underlying data that is stored at a given
 * position.
 *
 * <p> Blocks can represent various shapes of underlying data. A Block can represent either sparse
 * or dense data. A Block can represent either single or multivalued data. A Block that represents
 * dense single-valued data can be viewed as a {@link Vector}.
 *
 * <p> Blocks are reference counted; to make a shallow copy of a block (e.g. if a {@link Page} contains
 * the same column twice), use {@link Block#incRef()}. Before a block is garbage collected,
 * {@link Block#close()} must be called to release a block's resources; it must also be called one
 * additional time for each time {@link Block#incRef()} was called. Calls to {@link Block#decRef()} and
 * {@link Block#close()} are equivalent.
 *
 * <p> Block are immutable and can be passed between threads as long as no two threads hold a reference to
 * the same block at the same time.

= ES|QL Generative Tests

These tests generate random queries and execute them.

The intention is not to test the single commands, but rather to test how ES|QL query engine
(parser, optimizers, query layout, compute) manages very complex queries.

The test workflow is the following:

1. Generate a source command (eg. `FROM idx`)
2. Execute it
3. Check the result
4. Based on the previous query output, generate a pipe command (eg. `| EVAL foo = to_lower(bar))`
5. Append the command to the query and execute it
6. Check the result
7. If the query is less than N commands (see `GenerativeRestTest.MAX_DEPTH)`, go to point `4`

This workflow is executed M times (see `GenerativeRestTest.ITERATIONS`)

The result check happens at two levels:

* query success/failure - If the query fails:
  ** If the error is in `GenerativeRestTest.ALLOWED_ERRORS`, ignore it and start with next iteration.
  ** Otherwise throw an assertion error
* check result correctness - this is delegated to last executed command generator

== Implementing your own command generator

If you implement a new command, and you want it to be tested by the generative tests, you can add a command generator here.

All you have to do is:

* add a class in `org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.qa.rest.generative.command.source` (if it's a source command) or in `org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.qa.rest.generative.command.pipe` (if it's a pipe command)
* Implement `CommandGenerator` interface (see its javadoc, it should be explicative. Or just have a look at one of the existing commands, eg. `SortGenerator`)
** Implement `CommandGenerator.generate()` method, that will return the command.
** Implement `CommandGenerator.validateOutput()` to validate the output of the query.
* Add your class to `EsqlQueryGenerator.SOURCE_COMMANDS` (if it's a source command) or `EsqlQueryGenerator.PIPE_COMMANDS` (if it's a pipe command).
* Run `GenerativeIT` at least a couple of times: these tests can be pretty noisy.
* If you get unexpected errors (real bugs in ES|QL), please open an issue and add the error to `GenerativeRestTest.ALLOWED_ERRORS`. Run tests again until everything works fine.

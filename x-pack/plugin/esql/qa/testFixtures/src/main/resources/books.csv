6,7541,A Writer's Diary (Volume 1: 1873-1876),Fyodor Dostoevsky,1997,Northwestern University Press,4.50,Winner of the AATSEEL Outstanding Translation Award This is the first paperback edition of the complete collection of writings that has been called Dostoevsky's boldest experiment with literary form\, it is a uniquely encyclopedic forum of fictional and nonfictional genres. The Diary's radical format was matched by the extreme range of its contents. In a single frame it incorporated an astonishing variety of material: short stories\, humorous sketches\, reports on sensational crimes\, historical predictions\, portraits of famous people\, autobiographical pieces\, and plans for stories\, some of which were never written while others appeared in the Diary itself.
7,7400,Anna Karenina: Television Tie-In Edition (Signet classics),[Leo Tolstoy, SBP Editors],2019,Samaira Book Publishers,4.45,The Russian novelist and moral philosopher Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) ranks as one of the world s great writers\, and his 'War and Peace' has been called the greatest novel ever written. But during his long lifetime\, Tolstoy also wrote enough shorter works to fill many volumes. The message in all his stories is presented with such humour that the reader hardly realises that it is strongly didactic. These stories give a snapshot of Russia and its people in the late nineteenth century.
8,4917,Autumn of the Patriarch,Gabriel Garcia Marquez,2014,Penguin UK,4.33,Gabriel Garcia Marquez\, winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature and author of One Hundred Years of Solitude\, explores the loneliness of power in Autumn of the Patriarch. 'Over the weekend the vultures got into the presidential palace by pecking through the screens on the balcony windows and the flapping of their wings stirred up the stagnant time inside' As the citizens of an unnamed Caribbean nation creep through dusty corridors in search of their tyrannical leader\, they cannot comprehend that the frail and withered man lying dead on the floor can be the self-styled General of the Universe. Their arrogant\, manically violent leader\, known for serving up traitors to dinner guests and drowning young children at sea\, can surely not die the humiliating death of a mere mortal? Tracing the demands of a man whose egocentric excesses mask the loneliness of isolation and whose lies have become so ingrained that they are indistinguishable from truth\, Marquez has created a fantastical portrait of despotism that rings with an air of reality. 'Delights with its quirky humanity and black humour and impresses by its total originality' Vogue 'Captures perfectly the moral squalor and political paralysis that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator' Guardian 'Marquez writes in this lyrical\, magical language that no-one else can do' Salman Rushdie

14,8534,Crime and Punishment (Oxford World's Classics),Fyodor Dostoevsky,2017,Oxford University Press,4.38,'One death\, in exchange for thousands of lives - it's simple arithmetic!' A new translation of Dostoevsky's epic masterpiece\, Crime and Punishment (1866). The impoverished student Raskolnikov decides to free himself from debt by killing an old moneylender\, an act he sees as elevating himself above conventional morality. Like Napoleon he will assert his will and his crime will be justified by its elimination of 'vermin' for the sake of the greater good. But Raskolnikov is torn apart by fear\, guilt\, and a growing conscience under the influence of his love for Sonya. Meanwhile the police detective Porfiry is on his trial. It is a powerfully psychological novel\, in which the St Petersburg setting\, Dostoevsky's own circumstances\, and contemporary social problems all play their part.

16,6970,Domestic Goddesses,Edith Vonnegut,1998,Pomegranate,4.67,In this immensely charming and insightful book\, artist Edith Vonnegut takes issue with traditional art imagery in which women are shown as weak and helpless. Through twenty-seven of her own paintings interspersed with her text\, she poignantly -- and humorously -- illustrates her maxim that the lives of mothers and homemakers are filled with endless challenges and vital decisions that should be portrayed with the dignity they deserve. In Vonnegut's paintings\, one woman bravely blocks the sun from harming a child (Sun Block) while another vacuums the stairs with angelic figures singing her praises (Electrolux). In contrasting her own Domestic Goddesses with the diaphanous women of classical art (seven paintings by masters such as Titian and Botticelli are included)\, she 'expresses the importance of traditional roles of women so cleverly and with such joy that her message and images will be forever emblazoned on our collective psyche.

19,2936,Fellowship of the Ring 2ND Edition,John Ronald Reuel Tolkien,2008,HarperCollins UK,4.43,Sauron\, the Dark Lord\, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power - the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all - which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit\, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire\, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task\, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom\, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose. JRR Tolkien's great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely\, epic and diabolic\, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.

In the stark form of homily that shapes these later works\, life considered as one's own has no rational meaning. From the chain of events that follows in the wake of two schoolboys' deception in 'The Forged Coupon' to the disillusionment of the narrator in 'After the Ball' we see\, in Virginia Woolf's observation\, that Tolstoy puts at the centre of his writing one 'who gathers into himself all experience\, turns the world round between his fingers\, and never ceases to ask\, even as he enjoys it\, what is the meaning of it'. The riverrun edition reissues the translation of Louise and Aylmer Maude\, whose influential versions of Tolstoy first brought his work to a wide readership in English.

39,7350,Return of the Shadow,[John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien],2000,Mariner Books,5.00,In this sixth volume of The History of Middle-earth the story reaches The Lord of the Rings. In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes\, with full citation of the earliest notes\, outline plans\, and narrative drafts\, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book\, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when\, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative\, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire\, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle\, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits\, Frodo's companions\, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality\, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard\, in league with the Enemy\, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot. The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time\, as the Company of the Ring\, still lacking Legolas and Gimli\, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria. The Return of the Shadow is illustrated with reproductions of the first maps and notable pages from the earliest manuscripts.

48,5948,That We Are Gentle Creatures,Fyodor Dostoevsky,2009,OUP Oxford,4.33,In the stories in this volume Dostoevsky explores both the figure of the dreamer divorced from reality and also his own ambiguous attitude to utopianism\, themes central to many of his great novels. In White Nights the apparent idyll of the dreamer's romantic fantasies disguises profound loneliness and estrangement from 'living life'. Despite his sentimental friendship with Nastenka\, his final withdrawal into the world of the imagination anticipates the retreat into the 'underground' of many of Dostoevsky's later intellectual heroes. A Gentle Creature and The Dream of a Ridiculous Man show how such withdrawal from reality can end in spiritual desolation and moral indifference and how\, in Dostoevsky's view\, the tragedy of the alienated individual can be resolved only by the rediscovery of a sense of compassion and responsibility towards fellow human beings. This new translation captures the power and lyricism of Dostoevsky's writing\, while the introduction examines the stories in relation to one another and to his novels. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship\, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features\, including expert introductions by leading authorities\, helpful notes to clarify the text\, up-to-date bibliographies for further study\, and much more.
49,1937,The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky (Modern Library),Fyodor Dostoevsky,2012,Modern Library,4.33,This collection\, unique to the Modern Library\, gathers seven of Dostoevsky's key works and shows him to be equally adept at the short story as with the novel. Exploring many of the same themes as in his longer works\, these small masterpieces move from the tender and romantic White Nights\, an archetypal nineteenth-century morality tale of pathos and loss\, to the famous Notes from the Underground\, a story of guilt\, ineffectiveness\, and uncompromising cynicism\, and the first major work of existential literature. Among Dostoevsky's prototypical characters is Yemelyan in The Honest Thief\, whose tragedy turns on an inability to resist crime. Presented in chronological order\, in David Magarshack's celebrated translation\, this is the definitive edition of Dostoevsky's best stories.
50,2776,The Devil and Other Stories (Oxford World's Classics),Leo Tolstoy,2003,OUP Oxford,5.00,'It is impossible to explain why Yevgeny chose Liza Annenskaya\, as it is always impossible to explain why a man chooses this and not that woman.' This collection of eleven stories spans virtually the whole of Tolstoy's creative life. While each is unique in form\, as a group they are representative of his style\, and touch on the central themes that surface in War and Peace and Anna Karenina. Stories as different as 'The Snowstorm'\, 'Lucerne'\, 'The Diary of a Madman'\, and 'The Devil' are grounded in autobiographical experience. They deal with journeys of self-discovery and the moral and religious questioning that characterizes Tolstoy's works of criticism and philosophy. 'Strider' and 'Father Sergy'\, as well as reflecting Tolstoy's own experiences\, also reveal profound psychological insights. These stories range over much of the Russian world of the nineteenth century\, from the nobility to the peasantry\, the military to the clergy\, from merchants and cobblers to a horse and a tree. Together they present a fascinating picture of Tolstoy's skill and artistry.

54,2540,The Inspector General (Language - Russian) (Russian Edition),[Nicolai Gogol, Thomas Seltzer],2014,CreateSpace,3.50,The Inspector-General is a national institution. To place a purely literary valuation upon it and call it the greatest of Russian comedies would not convey the significance of its position either in Russian literature or in Russian life itself. There is no other single work in the modern literature of any language that carries with it the wealth of associations which the Inspector-General does to the educated Russian.
55,2951,The Insulted and Injured,Fyodor Dostoevsky,2011,Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,4.00,The Insulted and Injured\, which came out in 1861\, was Fyodor Dostoevsky's first major work of fiction after his Siberian exile and the first of the long novels that made him famous. Set in nineteenth-century Petersburg\, this gripping novel features a vividly drawn set of characters - including Vanya (Dostoevsky's semi-autobiographical hero)\, Natasha (the woman he loves)\, and Alyosha (Natasha's aristocratic lover) - all suffering from the cruelly selfish machinations of Alyosha's father\, the dark and powerful Prince Valkovsky. Boris Jakim's fresh English-language rendering of this gem in the Doestoevsky canon is both more colorful and more accurate than any earlier translation. --from back cover.

This\, the third volume of The History of Middle-earth\, gives us a priviledged insight into the creation of the mythology of Middle-earth\, through the alliterative verse tales of two of the most crucial stories in Tolkien's world -- those of Turien and Luthien.

The second is the moving Lay of Leithian\, the chief source of the tale of Beren and Luthien in The Silmarillion\, telling of the Quest of the Silmaril and the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days. Also included is the notable criticism of The Lay of The Leithian by CS Lewis\, who read the poem in 1929.

Tolkien's classic prelude to his Lord of the Rings trilogy\, features cover art\, illustrations\, and watercolor paintings by the artist Alan Lee. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable\, unambitious life\, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar.

66,1211,The brothers Karamazov,Fyodor Dostoevsky,2003,Bantam Classics,1.00,In 1880 Dostoevsky completed The Brothers Karamazov\, the literary effort for which he had been preparing all his life. Compelling\, profound\, complex\, it is the story of a patricide and of the four sons who each had a motive for murder: Dmitry\, the sensualist\, Ivan\, the intellectual\, Alyosha\, the mystic\, and twisted\, cunning Smerdyakov\, the bastard child. Frequently lurid\, nightmarish\, always brilliant\, the novel plunges the reader into a sordid love triangle\, a pathological obsession\, and a gripping courtroom drama. But throughout the whole\, Dostoevsky searhes for the truth--about man\, about life\, about the existence of God. A terrifying answer to man's eternal questions\, this monumental work remains the crowning achievement of perhaps the finest novelist of all time. From the Paperback edition.

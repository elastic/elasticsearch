// This file contains any ESQL snippets from the docs that don't have a home
// anywhere else. The Isle of Misfit Toys. When you need to add new examples
// for the docs you should try to convert an existing test first. Just add
// the comments in whatever file the test already lives in. If you have to
// write a new test to make an example in the docs then put it in whatever
// file matches it's "theme" best. Put it next to similar tests. Not here.
 
// Also! When Nik originally extracted examples from the docs to make them
// testable he didn't spend a lot of time putting the docs into appropriate
// files. He just made this one. He didn't put his toys away. We'd be better
// off not adding to this strange toy-pile and instead moving things into
// the appropriate files.

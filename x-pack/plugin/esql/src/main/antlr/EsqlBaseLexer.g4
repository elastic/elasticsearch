/*
 * Before modifying this file or the files in the `lexer` subdirectory, please read
 * the section below as changes here  have significant impact in the ANTLR generated
 * code and its consumption in Kibana.
 *
 * A. To add a development command (only available behind in snapshot/dev builds)
 *
 * Since the tokens/modes are in development, add a predicate like this:
 * DEV_MYCOMMAND : {this.isDevVersion()}? 'mycommand' -> ...
 *
 * B. To add a new (production-ready) token
 *
 * Be sure to go through step A (add a development token).
 * Make sure to remove the prefix and conditional before promoting the tokens in
 * production.
 *
 * C. Renaming a token
 *
 * Avoid renaming the token. But if you really have to, please check with the
 * Kibana team as they might be using the generated ANTLR "dictionary".
 *
 * D. To remove a token
 *
 * If the tokens haven't made it to production (and make sure to double check),
 * simply remove them from the grammar.
 * If the tokens get promoted to release, check with the Kibana team the impact
 * they have on the UI (auto-completion, etc...)
 */

/*
 * Import lexer grammars for each command, making sure to import
 * the UNKNOWN_CMD token *last* because it takes over parsing for
 * all other commands.

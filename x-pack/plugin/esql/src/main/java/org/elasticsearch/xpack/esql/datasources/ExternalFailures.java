/**
 * Classifies a failure raised while reading an external data source into the exception the
 * {@code AsyncExternalSourceOperator} should surface, so that it maps to the right HTTP status.
 * <p>
 * This is the single boundary where external-source reads turn into a user-visible error, and it is
 * reached only for external-source queries (the operator exists only for them), so index queries are
 * unaffected. It runs co-located with the throw, on the node that reads the external source, before
 * the failure is serialized back to the coordinator — so classification relies on the concrete
 * exception type while it is still available, and only the resulting {@code status()} needs to cross
 * the wire (see {@link org.elasticsearch.xpack.esql.datasources.spi.ExternalException}). The policy:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link Error} (assertion failures, OOM, …) is rethrown — a JVM/programming fault must stay
 *     fatal, never be downgraded to a request error.</li>
 *     <li>An {@link ElasticsearchException} already carries its own status and is returned unchanged:
 *     this covers the {@link ExternalException} family (400/429/500/503) raised at the reader/storage
 *     boundary, as well as {@code CircuitBreakingException} (429) and {@code TaskCancelledException}
 *     (400).</li>
 *     <li>An {@link IllegalArgumentException} already maps to 400; it is returned as-is.</li>
 *     <li>An {@link IOException}/{@link UncheckedIOException}, or one of the specific third-party
 *     decoding exceptions in {@link #MALFORMED_DATA_EXCEPTIONS}, means we could not read or interpret
 *     the resource — a client-class {@link ExternalClientException} (400). Retryable transport failures
 *     never reach here as plain I/O errors: the storage layer raises them as {@link ExternalException}
 *     (503) first.</li>
 *     <li>Anything else ({@link IllegalStateException}, {@link NullPointerException}, an unrecognized
 *     {@link RuntimeException}) indicates a broken invariant in our own code rather than bad input,
 *     so it surfaces as an {@link ExternalServerException} (500) to keep the bug visible.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Cancellation is not special-cased here: it arrives as a {@code TaskCancelledException} (handled by the
 * {@link ElasticsearchException} branch, 400), and a read interrupted while blocking surfaces as an
 * {@link IOException} subclass (so, 400). A bare {@link InterruptedException} would fall through to 500;
 * the interrupt flag is intentionally left untouched, since this runs on the thread surfacing the stored
 * failure, not the worker thread that was interrupted.

/**
 * When deciding if a filter or topN can be pushed down to Lucene, we need to check a few things on the field.
 * Exactly what is checked depends on the type of field and the query. For example, we have the following possible combinations:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>A normal filter on a normal field will be pushed down using SingleValueQuery to remove multi-valued results,
 *         and this requires knowing if the field is indexed and has doc-values.</li>
 *     <li>A filter using a spatial function will allow multi-valued fields and we only need to know if the field is indexed,
 *         and do not need doc values.</li>
 *     <li>A TopN will be pushed down if the field is indexed and has doc values.</li>
 *     <li>Filters with TEXT fields can only be pushed down if the TEXT field has a nested KEYWORD field,
 *         referred to here as ExactSubfield. This that this is related to normal ES|QL predicates,
 *         not the full-text search provided by the MATCH and QSTR functions, which are pushed down separately.</li>

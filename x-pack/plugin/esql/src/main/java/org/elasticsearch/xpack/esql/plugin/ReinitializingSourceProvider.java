/**
 * This class exists as a workaround for using SourceProvider in the compute engine.
 * <p>
 * The main issue is when compute engine executes concurrently with data partitioning by docid (inter segment parallelization).
 * A {@link SourceProvider} can only be used by a single thread and this wrapping source provider ensures that each thread uses
 * its own {@link SourceProvider}.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this source provider protects against going backwards, which the synthetic source provider can't handle.

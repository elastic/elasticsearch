/**
 * A manager of {@link com.nvidia.cuvs.CuVSResources}. There is one manager per GPU.
 *
 * <p>All access to GPU resources is mediated through a manager. A manager helps coordinate usage threads to:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>ensure single-threaded access to any particular resource at a time</li>
 *     <li>Control the total number of concurrent operations that may be performed on a GPU</li>
 *     <li>Pool resources, to avoid frequent creation and destruction, which are expensive operations. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Fundamentally, a resource is used in compute and memory bound operations. The former occurs prior to the latter, e.g.
 * index build (compute), followed by a copy/process of the newly built index (memory). The manager allows the resource
 * user to indicate that compute is complete before releasing the resources. This can help improve parallelism of compute
 * on the GPU - allowing the next compute operation to proceed before releasing the resources.
 *

 * we will need to migrate existing endpoints. To do this we will retrieve the latest preconfigured endpoints for the authorization API
 * and update the endpoints that were already stored in the index. If the endpoint is new we can simply store it instead of updating it.
 * <p>
 * To determine if an endpoint is new or existing, we will use the internal version field within {@link EndpointMetadata#internal()}.
 * We will compare the version field of the existing endpoint with the value of {@link #ENDPOINT_VERSION}. If the endpoint's version is
 * less than the current version, we will migrate the endpoint to the latest schema. If it is the same (or greater for some reason),
 * we will leave it as is.

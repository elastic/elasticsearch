/**
 * Opens named pipes that are created elsewhere.
 *
 * In production, these will have been created in C++ code, as the procedure for creating them is
 * platform dependent and uses native OS calls that are not easily available in Java.
 *
 * Once the named pipes have been created elsewhere Java can open them like normal files, however,
 * there are complications:
 * - On *nix, when opening a pipe for output Java will create a normal file of the requested name
 *   if the named pipe doesn't already exist.  To avoid this, named pipes are only opened for
 *   for output once the expected file name exists in the file system.
 * - On Windows, the server end of a pipe needs to reset it between client connects.  Methods like
 *   File.isFile() and File.exists() on Windows internally call the Win32 API function CreateFile()
 *   followed by GetFileInformationByHandle(), and if the CreateFile() succeeds it counts as opening
 *   the named pipe, requiring it to be reset on the server side before subsequent access.  To avoid
 *   this, the check for whether a given path represents a named pipe is done using simple string
 *   comparison on Windows.

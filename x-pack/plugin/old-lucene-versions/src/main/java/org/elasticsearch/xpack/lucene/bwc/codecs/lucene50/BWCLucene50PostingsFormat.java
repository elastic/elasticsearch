/**
 * Lucene 5.0 postings format, which encodes postings in packed integer blocks for fast decode.
 *
 * <p>Basic idea:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Packed Blocks and VInt Blocks</b>:
 *       <p>In packed blocks, integers are encoded with the same bit width ({@link PackedInts packed
 *       format}): the block size (i.e. number of integers inside block) is fixed (currently 128).
 *       Additionally blocks that are all the same value are encoded in an optimized way.
 *       <p>In VInt blocks, integers are encoded as {@link DataOutput#writeVInt VInt}: the block
 *       size is variable.
 *   <li><b>Block structure</b>:
 *       <p>When the postings are long enough, Lucene50PostingsFormat will try to encode most
 *       integer data as a packed block.
 *       <p>Take a term with 259 documents as an example, the first 256 document ids are encoded as
 *       two packed blocks, while the remaining 3 are encoded as one VInt block.
 *       <p>Different kinds of data are always encoded separately into different packed blocks, but
 *       may possibly be interleaved into the same VInt block.
 *       <p>This strategy is applied to pairs: &lt;document number, frequency&gt;, &lt;position,
 *       payload length&gt;, &lt;position, offset start, offset length&gt;, and &lt;position,
 *       payload length, offsetstart, offset length&gt;.
 *   <li><b>Skipdata settings</b>:
 *       <p>The structure of skip table is quite similar to previous version of Lucene. Skip
 *       interval is the same as block size, and each skip entry points to the beginning of each
 *       block. However, for the first block, skip data is omitted.
 *   <li><b>Positions, Payloads, and Offsets</b>:
 *       <p>A position is an integer indicating where the term occurs within one document. A payload
 *       is a blob of metadata associated with current position. An offset is a pair of integers
 *       indicating the tokenized start/end offsets for given term in current position: it is
 *       essentially a specialized payload.
 *       <p>When payloads and offsets are not omitted, numPositions==numPayloads==numOffsets
 *       (assuming a null payload contributes one count). As mentioned in block structure, it is
 *       possible to encode these three either combined or separately.
 *       <p>In all cases, payloads and offsets are stored together. When encoded as a packed block,
 *       position data is separated out as .pos, while payloads and offsets are encoded in .pay
 *       (payload metadata will also be stored directly in .pay). When encoded as VInt blocks, all
 *       these three are stored interleaved into the .pos (so is payload metadata).
 *       <p>With this strategy, the majority of payload and offset data will be outside .pos file.
 *       So for queries that require only position data, running on a full index with payloads and
 *       offsets, this reduces disk pre-fetches.
 * </ul>

 * <p>Files and detailed format:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>.tim</code>: <a href="#Termdictionary">Term Dictionary</a>
 *   <li><code>.tip</code>: <a href="#Termindex">Term Index</a>
 *   <li><code>.doc</code>: <a href="#Frequencies">Frequencies and Skip Data</a>

 *   <li><code>.pay</code>: <a href="#Payloads">Payloads and Offsets</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a id="Termdictionary"></a>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dd><b>Term Dictionary</b>
 *       <p>The .tim file contains the list of terms in each field along with per-term statistics
 *       (such as docfreq) and pointers to the frequencies, positions, payload and skip data in the
 *       .doc, .pos, and .pay files. See {@code BlockTreeTermsWriter} for more details on the
 *       format.
 *       <p>NOTE: The term dictionary can plug into different postings implementations: the postings
 *       writer/reader are actually responsible for encoding and decoding the PostingsHeader and
 *       TermMetadata sections described here:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>PostingsHeader --&gt; Header, PackedBlockSize
 *         <li>TermMetadata --&gt; (DocFPDelta|SingletonDocID), PosFPDelta?, PosVIntBlockFPDelta?,
 *             PayFPDelta?, SkipFPDelta?
 *         <li>Header, --&gt; {@link CodecUtil#writeIndexHeader IndexHeader}
 *         <li>PackedBlockSize, SingletonDocID --&gt; {@link DataOutput#writeVInt VInt}
 *         <li>DocFPDelta, PosFPDelta, PayFPDelta, PosVIntBlockFPDelta, SkipFPDelta --&gt; {@link
 *             DataOutput#writeVLong VLong}
 *         <li>Footer --&gt; {@link CodecUtil#writeFooter CodecFooter}
 *       </ul>
 *       <p>Notes:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Header is a {@link CodecUtil#writeIndexHeader IndexHeader} storing the version
 *             information for the postings.
 *         <li>PackedBlockSize is the fixed block size for packed blocks. In packed block, bit width
 *             is determined by the largest integer. Smaller block size result in smaller variance
 *             among width of integers hence smaller indexes. Larger block size result in more
 *             efficient bulk i/o hence better acceleration. This value should always be a multiple
 *             of 64, currently fixed as 128 as a tradeoff. It is also the skip interval used to
 *             accelerate {@link org.apache.lucene.index.PostingsEnum#advance(int)}.
 *         <li>DocFPDelta determines the position of this term's TermFreqs within the .doc file. In
 *             particular, it is the difference of file offset between this term's data and previous
 *             term's data (or zero, for the first term in the block).On disk it is stored as the
 *             difference from previous value in sequence.
 *         <li>PosFPDelta determines the position of this term's TermPositions within the .pos file.
 *             While PayFPDelta determines the position of this term's &lt;TermPayloads,
 *             TermOffsets?&gt; within the .pay file. Similar to DocFPDelta, it is the difference
 *             between two file positions (or neglected, for fields that omit payloads and offsets).
 *         <li>PosVIntBlockFPDelta determines the position of this term's last TermPosition in last
 *             pos packed block within the .pos file. It is synonym for PayVIntBlockFPDelta or
 *             OffsetVIntBlockFPDelta. This is actually used to indicate whether it is necessary to
 *             load following payloads and offsets from .pos instead of .pay. Every time a new block
 *             of positions are to be loaded, the PostingsReader will use this value to check
 *             whether current block is packed format or VInt. When packed format, payloads and
 *             offsets are fetched from .pay, otherwise from .pos. (this value is neglected when
 *             total number of positions i.e. totalTermFreq is less or equal to PackedBlockSize).
 *         <li>SkipFPDelta determines the position of this term's SkipData within the .doc file. In
 *             particular, it is the length of the TermFreq data. SkipDelta is only stored if
 *             DocFreq is not smaller than SkipMinimum (i.e. 128 in Lucene50PostingsFormat).
 *         <li>SingletonDocID is an optimization when a term only appears in one document. In this
 *             case, instead of writing a file pointer to the .doc file (DocFPDelta), and then a
 *             VIntBlock at that location, the single document ID is written to the term dictionary.

 *   <dd><b>Frequencies and Skip Data</b>
 *       <p>The .doc file contains the lists of documents which contain each term, along with the
 *       frequency of the term in that document (except when frequencies are omitted: {@link
 *       IndexOptions#DOCS}). It also saves skip data to the beginning of each packed or VInt block,
 *       when the length of document list is larger than packed block size.

 *       </ul>
 *       <p>Notes:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>PackedDocDeltaBlock is theoretically generated from two steps:
 *             <ol>
 *               <li>Calculate the difference between each document number and previous one, and get
 *                   a d-gaps list (for the first document, use absolute value);
 *               <li>For those d-gaps from first one to
 *                   PackedDocBlockNum*PackedBlockSize<sup>th</sup>, separately encode as packed
 *                   blocks.
 *             </ol>
 *             If frequencies are not omitted, PackedFreqBlock will be generated without d-gap step.
 *         <li>VIntBlock stores remaining d-gaps (along with frequencies when possible) with a
 *             format that encodes DocDelta and Freq:
 *             <p>DocDelta: if frequencies are indexed, this determines both the document number and
 *             the frequency. In particular, DocDelta/2 is the difference between this document
 *             number and the previous document number (or zero when this is the first document in a
 *             TermFreqs). When DocDelta is odd, the frequency is one. When DocDelta is even, the
 *             frequency is read as another VInt. If frequencies are omitted, DocDelta contains the
 *             gap (not multiplied by 2) between document numbers and no frequency information is
 *             stored.
 *             <p>For example, the TermFreqs for a term which occurs once in document seven and
 *             three times in document eleven, with frequencies indexed, would be the following
 *             sequence of VInts:
 *             <p>15, 8, 3
 *             <p>If frequencies were omitted ({@link IndexOptions#DOCS}) it would be this sequence
 *             of VInts instead:
 *             <p>7,4
 *         <li>PackedDocBlockNum is the number of packed blocks for current term's docids or
 *             frequencies. In particular, PackedDocBlockNum = floor(DocFreq/PackedBlockSize)
 *         <li>TrimmedDocFreq = DocFreq % PackedBlockSize == 0 ? DocFreq - 1 : DocFreq. We use this
 *             trick since the definition of skip entry is a little different from base interface.
 *             In {@link MultiLevelSkipListWriter}, skip data is assumed to be saved for
 *             skipInterval<sup>th</sup>, 2*skipInterval<sup>th</sup> ... posting in the list.
 *             However, in Lucene50PostingsFormat, the skip data is saved for
 *             skipInterval+1<sup>th</sup>, 2*skipInterval+1<sup>th</sup> ... posting
 *             (skipInterval==PackedBlockSize in this case). When DocFreq is multiple of
 *             PackedBlockSize, MultiLevelSkipListWriter will expect one more skip data than
 *             Lucene50SkipWriter.
 *         <li>SkipDatum is the metadata of one skip entry. For the first block (no matter packed or
 *             VInt), it is omitted.
 *         <li>DocSkip records the document number of every PackedBlockSize<sup>th</sup> document
 *             number in the postings (i.e. last document number in each packed block). On disk it
 *             is stored as the difference from previous value in the sequence.
 *         <li>DocFPSkip records the file offsets of each block (excluding )posting at
 *             PackedBlockSize+1<sup>th</sup>, 2*PackedBlockSize+1<sup>th</sup> ... , in DocFile.
 *             The file offsets are relative to the start of current term's TermFreqs. On disk it is
 *             also stored as the difference from previous SkipDatum in the sequence.
 *         <li>Since positions and payloads are also block encoded, the skip should skip to related
 *             block first, then fetch the values according to in-block offset. PosFPSkip and
 *             PayFPSkip record the file offsets of related block in .pos and .pay, respectively.
 *             While PosBlockOffset indicates which value to fetch inside the related block
 *             (PayBlockOffset is unnecessary since it is always equal to PosBlockOffset). Same as
 *             DocFPSkip, the file offsets are relative to the start of current term's TermFreqs,
 *             and stored as a difference sequence.
 *         <li>PayByteUpto indicates the start offset of the current payload. It is equivalent to
 *             the sum of the payload lengths in the current block up to PosBlockOffset
 *       </ul>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <a id="Positions"></a>
 *
 * <dl>
 *   <dd><b>Positions</b>
 *       <p>The .pos file contains the lists of positions that each term occurs at within documents.
 *       It also sometimes stores part of payloads and offsets for speedup.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>PosFile(.pos) --&gt; Header, &lt;TermPositions&gt; <sup>TermCount</sup>, Footer
 *         <li>Header --&gt; {@link CodecUtil#writeIndexHeader IndexHeader}

 *             OffsetLength?&gt;<sup>PosVIntCount</sup>
 *         <li>PackedPosDeltaBlock --&gt; {@link PackedInts PackedInts}
 *         <li>PositionDelta, OffsetDelta, OffsetLength --&gt; {@link DataOutput#writeVInt VInt}
 *         <li>PayloadData --&gt; {@link DataOutput#writeByte byte}<sup>PayLength</sup>
 *         <li>Footer --&gt; {@link CodecUtil#writeFooter CodecFooter}
 *       </ul>
 *       <p>Notes:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>TermPositions are order by term (terms are implicit, from the term dictionary), and
 *             position values for each term document pair are incremental, and ordered by document
 *             number.
 *         <li>PackedPosBlockNum is the number of packed blocks for current term's positions,
 *             payloads or offsets. In particular, PackedPosBlockNum =
 *             floor(totalTermFreq/PackedBlockSize)
 *         <li>PosVIntCount is the number of positions encoded as VInt format. In particular,
 *             PosVIntCount = totalTermFreq - PackedPosBlockNum*PackedBlockSize
 *         <li>The procedure how PackedPosDeltaBlock is generated is the same as PackedDocDeltaBlock
 *             in chapter <a href="#Frequencies">Frequencies and Skip Data</a>.
 *         <li>PositionDelta is, if payloads are disabled for the term's field, the difference
 *             between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous
 *             occurrence (or zero, if this is the first occurrence in this document). If payloads
 *             are enabled for the term's field, then PositionDelta/2 is the difference between the
 *             current and the previous position. If payloads are enabled and PositionDelta is odd,
 *             then PayloadLength is stored, indicating the length of the payload at the current
 *             term position.
 *         <li>For example, the TermPositions for a term which occurs as the fourth term in one
 *             document, and as the fifth and ninth term in a subsequent document, would be the
 *             following sequence of VInts (payloads disabled):
 *             <p>4, 5, 4
 *         <li>PayloadData is metadata associated with the current term position. If PayloadLength
 *             is stored at the current position, then it indicates the length of this payload. If
 *             PayloadLength is not stored, then this payload has the same length as the payload at
 *             the previous position.
 *         <li>OffsetDelta/2 is the difference between this position's startOffset from the previous
 *             occurrence (or zero, if this is the first occurrence in this document). If
 *             OffsetDelta is odd, then the length (endOffset-startOffset) differs from the previous
 *             occurrence and an OffsetLength follows. Offset data is only written for {@link
 *             IndexOptions#DOCS_AND_FREQS_AND_POSITIONS_AND_OFFSETS}.

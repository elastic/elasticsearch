/*
 * This QA test is intended to smoke test all security realms with minimal dependencies.
 * That is, it makes sure a node that has every realm configured can start, and tests those realms that can be tested without needing external services.
 * This tradeoff is intentional because we want this set of tests to be very stable - failures in this QA suite should be an indicator that
 *    something is broken in Elasticsearch (and not that an external docker fixture broke)
 * This test is also intended to work correctly on FIPS mode because we also want to know if a realm breaks on FIPS.

// To mute tests follow example in file: example.sql-spec

// Unsigned long tests
//

// H2 doesn't support our unsigned_long type, casting to it isn't possible.
// Values larger than Long.MAX_VALUE are returned as BigDecimal.
// EXPM1 and CBRT functions not available.
// RAND takes an int.
// ROUND only works for values < Long.MAX_VALUE
// ES's CEIL & FLOOR don't work with unsigned_longs (TODO) + they can return longs, while H2's always returns doubles
// Divide and Modulo operations lose precision in H2 on big numbers (led to random failures in the past, so they were removed)

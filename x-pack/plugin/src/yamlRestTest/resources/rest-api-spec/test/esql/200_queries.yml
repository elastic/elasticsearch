# Since this feature requires queries in the background, the yaml tests only test edge cases with
# no running queries. The rest are covered by integration tests (See EsqlListQueriesActionIT).
List with no running queries:
  - do:
      esql.list_queries: { }
  - match: { queries: { } }

Get with invalid task ID:
  - do:
      catch: /malformed task id foobar/
      esql.get_query:
        id: "foobar"

Get with non-existent task ID:
  - do:
      catch: /task \[foobar:1234\] belongs to the node \[foobar\] which isn't part of the cluster and there is no record of the task/
      esql.get_query:

/**
 * This class can be used to keep track of when a long running operation started and
 * to check whether it has run for longer than permitted.
 *
 * An object should be constructed at the beginning of the operation and then the
 * {@link #check} method called periodically during the processing of the operation.
 *
 * This class does not use the {@link Thread#interrupt} mechanism because some other
 * methods already convert interruptions to other types of exceptions (for example
 * {@link Grok#captures}) and this would lead to non-uniform exception types and
 * misleading error messages in the event that the interrupt was handled by one of
 * these methods.  The code in the long running operation would still have to
 * periodically call {@link Thread#interrupt}, so it is not much more of an
 * inconvenience to have to periodically call this class's {@link #check} method.
